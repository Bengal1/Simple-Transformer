            "Wade Davis: Dreams from endangered cultures",
            "With stunning photos and stories, National Geographic Explorer Wade Davis celebrates the extraordinary diversity of the world's indigenous cultures, which are disappearing from the planet at an alarming rate.",
            "You know, one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways, who still feel their past in the wind, touch it in stones polished by rain, taste it in the bitter leaves of plants.",
            "Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way, or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning, or that in the Himalaya, the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma, is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology, and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense, but is just one model of reality, the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made, albeit successfully, many generations ago.",
            "And of course, we all share the same adaptive imperatives.",
            "We're all born. We all bring our children into the world.",
            "We go through initiation rites.",
            "We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death, so it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing, we all dance, we all have art.",
            "But what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song, the rhythm of the dance in every culture.",
            "And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo, or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti, or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya, the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes, or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara -- this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma, Everest, the goddess mother of the world.",
            "All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being, other ways of thinking, other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth.",
            "And this is an idea, if you think about it, can only fill you with hope.",
            "Now, together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet, and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere.",
            "And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere, and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myths, ideas, inspirations, intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness.",
            "The ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy.",
            "It's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species.",
            "And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded, so too is the ethnosphere -- and, if anything, at a far greater rate.",
            "No biologists, for example, would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true, and yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity -- scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity.",
            "And the great indicator of that, of course, is language loss.",
            "When each of you in this room were born, there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet.",
            "Now, a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules.",
            "A language is a flash of the human spirit.",
            "It's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world.",
            "Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind, a watershed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.",
            "And of those 6,000 languages, as we sit here today in Monterey, fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children.",
            "They're no longer being taught to babies, which means, effectively, unless something changes, they're already dead.",
            "What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence, to be the last of your people to speak your language, to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children?",
            "And yet, that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks, because every two weeks, some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue.",
            "And I know there's some of you who say, \"Well, wouldn't it be better, wouldn't the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language?\" And I say, \"Great, let's make that language Yoruba. Let's make it Cantonese.",
            "Let's make it Kogi.\"",
            "And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language.",
            "And so, what I'd like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere, a brief journey through the ethnosphere, to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost.",
            "Now, there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say \"different ways of being,\" I really do mean different ways of being.",
            "Take, for example, this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon, the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes.",
            "Now, this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend.",
            "They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called \"linguistic exogamy:\" you must marry someone who speaks a different language.",
            "And this is all rooted in the mythological past, yet the curious thing is in these long houses, where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage, you never hear anyone practicing a language.",
            "They simply listen and then begin to speak.",
            "Or, one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with, the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador, an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958.",
            "In 1957, five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake.",
            "They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures, forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives.",
            "They picked up these photographs from the forest floor, tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure, found nothing, and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil, so they speared the five missionaries to death.",
            "But the Waorani didn't just spear outsiders.",
            "They speared each other.",
            "54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other.",
            "We traced genealogies back eight generations, and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it, they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old, so we speared him anyway.",
            "But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing.",
            "Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind.",
            "In the early '80s, I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti, infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier's strength and Tonton Macoutes, and securing the poison used to make zombies.",
            "In order to make sense out of sensation, of course, I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun. And Voodoo is not a black magic cult.",
            "On the contrary, it's a complex metaphysical worldview.",
            "It's interesting.",
            "If I asked you to name the great religions of the world, what would you say?",
            "Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, whatever.",
            "There's always one continent left out, the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs. Well, of course, they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era.",
            "But, what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it's this living relationship between the living and the dead.",
            "So, the living give birth to the spirits.",
            "The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water, responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living, so that for that brief shining moment, the acolyte becomes the god.",
            "That's why the Voodooists like to say that \"You white people go to church and speak about God.",
            "We dance in the temple and become God.\"",
            "And because you are possessed, you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be harmed?",
            "So you see these astonishing demonstrations: Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity, a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation.",
            "Now, of all the peoples that I've ever been with, the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia.",
            "Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia, in the wake of the conquest, these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain.",
            "In a bloodstained continent, these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish.",
            "To this day, they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary.",
            "The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four, sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years: two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother's womb; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother.",
            "And for this entire time, they are inculturated into the values of their society, values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic -- or we might say the ecological -- balance.",
            "And at the end of this amazing initiation, one day they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18, they see a sunrise. And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape, suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory. And the priest steps back and says, \"You see? It's really as I've told you.",
            "It is that beautiful. It is yours to protect.\"",
            "They call themselves the \"elder brothers\" and they say we, who are the younger brothers, are the ones responsible for destroying the world.",
            "Now, this level of intuition becomes very important.",
            "Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape, we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the \"noble savage,\" which is an idea racist in its simplicity, or alternatively, we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are.",
            "Well, indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia.",
            "There's not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet, but they have, nevertheless, through time and ritual, forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it, but on a far subtler intuition: the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness.",
            "Now, what does that mean?",
            "It means that a young kid from the Andes who's raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined.",
            "Whether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant.",
            "What's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world.",
            "I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut.",
            "That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the Crooked Beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world, spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation.",
            "Now, if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities, you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant here.",
            "It's a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April.",
            "This is ayahuasca, which many of you have heard about, the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman's repertoire.",
            "What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation, but the elaboration of it. It's made really of two different sources: on the one hand, this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines, harmine, harmaline, mildly hallucinogenic -- to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness -- but it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis.",
            "This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines, very close to brain serotonin, dimethyltryptamine, 5-methoxydimethyltryptamine.",
            "If you've ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses, that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine.",
            "To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity.",
            "It doesn't create the distortion of reality; it creates the dissolution of reality.",
            "In fact, I used to argue with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes -- who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s -- I used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination.",
            "But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they're denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase.",
            "They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO.",
            "Now, the fascinating things are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine. So you ask yourself a question.",
            "How, in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants, do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way, created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts?",
            "Well, we use that great euphemism, \"trial and error,\" which is exposed to be meaningless.",
            "But you ask the Indians, and they say, \"The plants talk to us.\"",
            "Well, what does that mean?",
            "This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 varieties of ayahuasca, all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest, all of which are referable to our eye as one species.",
            "And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say, \"I thought you knew something about plants.",
            "I mean, don't you know anything?\" And I said, \"No.\"",
            "Well, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different key.",
            "Now, that's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard, but it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens.",
            "Now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world, meaning our world, moves on.",
            "Well, the truth is the 20th century, 300 years from now, is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations, but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet. Now, the problem isn't change.",
            "All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life.",
            "And the problem is not technology itself.",
            "The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and buggy.",
            "It's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere. It is power, the crude face of domination.",
            "Wherever you look around the world, you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to: whether it's the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan -- a nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago, and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers, where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away to the South China Sea, where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest -- or, in the case of the Yanomami, it's the disease entities that have come in, in the wake of the discovery of gold.",
            "Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research recently, you'll see it's a crude face of political domination.",
            "You know, genocide, the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned, but ethnocide, the destruction of people's way of life, is not only not condemned, it's universally, in many quarters, celebrated as part of a development strategy.",
            "And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level.",
            "I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague, and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about: 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes, 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution.",
            "This young man's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama.",
            "That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion.",
            "His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal.",
            "His mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy.",
            "He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn't bear to be without him.",
            "The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp.",
            "One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao, and for that transgression, she was given seven years of hard labor.",
            "The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear, but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold.",
            "And in the end, then, it really comes down to a choice: do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity?",
            "Margaret Mead, the great anthropologist, said, before she died, that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought, but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities.",
            "And it's humbling to remember that our species has, perhaps, been around for [150,000] years.",
            "The Neolithic Revolution -- which gave us agriculture, at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood; we created hierarchy specialization surplus -- is only 10,000 years ago.",
            "The modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old.",
            "Now, that shallow history doesn't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia.",
            "When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human, they respond with 10,000 different voices.",
            "And it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are: a fully conscious species, fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish. And there are great moments of optimism.",
            "This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people, and this man, Olayuk, told me a marvelous story of his grandfather.",
            "The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people, and during the 1950s, to establish our sovereignty, we forced them into settlements.",
            "This old man's grandfather refused to go.",
            "The family, fearful for his life, took away all of his weapons, all of his tools.",
            "Now, you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold; they took advantage of it.",
            "The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide.",
            "So, this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing.",
            "He simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand. And as the feces began to freeze, he shaped it into the form of a blade.",
            "He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid, he butchered a dog with it.",
            "He skinned the dog and improvised a harness, took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled, harnessed up an adjacent dog, and disappeared over the ice floes, shit knife in belt.",
            "Talk about getting by with nothing.",
            "And this, in many ways -- -- is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world.",
            "The Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together.",
            "It's our new homeland. It's called Nunavut.",
            "It's an independent territory. They control all mineral resources.",
            "An amazing example of how a nation-state can seek restitution with its people.",
            "And finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvious at least to all of all us who've traveled in these remote reaches of the planet, to realize that they're not remote at all.",
            "They're homelands of somebody.",
            "They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children, become part of the naked geography of hope.",
            "So, what we're trying to do at the National Geographic, finally, is, we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything.",
            "We think that polemics -- -- we think that polemics are not persuasive, but we think that storytelling can change the world, and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world. We get 35 million hits on our website every month.",
            "156 nations carry our television channel.",
            "Our magazines are read by millions.",
            "And what we're doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen, and hopefully, therefore, embrace gradually, one by one, the central revelation of anthropology: that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way, that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural, pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being.",
            "Thank you very much.",
            "Blaise Aguera y Arcas demos Photosynth",
            "Blaise Aguera y Arcas leads a dazzling demo of Photosynth, software that could transform the way we look at digital images. Using still photos culled from the Web, Photosynth builds breathtaking dreamscapes and lets us navigate them.",
            "What I'm going to show you first, as quickly as I can, is some foundational work, some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago. This is Seadragon, and it's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data.",
            "We're looking at many, many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in, panning through the thing, rearranging it in any way we want.",
            "And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at, how big these collections are or how big the images are.",
            "Most of them are ordinary digital camera photos, but this one, for example, is a scan from the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixel range.",
            "It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment. It's also very flexible architecture.",
            "This is an entire book, so this is an example of non-image data.",
            "This is \"Bleak House\" by Dickens. Every column is a chapter.",
            "To prove to you that it's really text, and not an image, we can do something like so, to really show that this is a real representation of the text; it's not a picture.",
            "Maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e-book.",
            "I wouldn't recommend it.",
            "This is a more realistic case. This is an issue of The Guardian.",
            "Every large image is the beginning of a section.",
            "And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper, which is an inherently multi-scale kind of medium.",
            "We've also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of The Guardian.",
            "We've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution -- much higher than you'd be able to get in an ordinary ad -- and we've embedded extra content.",
            "If you want to see the features of this car, you can see it here.",
            "Or other models, or even technical specifications.",
            "And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate.",
            "We hope that this means no more pop-ups and other kind of rubbish like that -- shouldn't be necessary.",

            "It's also simpler when you go into eukaryotes like ourselves: you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one, and that's what you've all heard about with cloning.",
            "With bacteria and Archaea, the chromosome is integrated into the cell, but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it.",
            "We purified a chromosome from one microbial species -- roughly, these two are as distant as human and mice -- we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome, we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins, and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell -- and you'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here.",
            "The new chromosome went into the cell.",
            "In fact, we thought this might be as far as it went, but we tried to design the process a little bit further.",
            "This is a major mechanism of evolution right here.",

            "Now I've argued, this is not genesis; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution.",
            "And I've argued that we're about to perhaps create a new version of the Cambrian explosion, where there's massive new speciation based on this digital design.",

            "Which is great, because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual.",
            "They believed that a genius was this, sort of magical divine entity, who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio, kind of like Dobby the house elf, and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work.",
            "So brilliant -- there it is, right there, that distance that I'm talking about -- that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work.",

            "Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame.",
            "And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time.",
            "And then the Renaissance came and everything changed, and we had this big idea, and the big idea was let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries, and there's no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine.",
            "And it's the beginning of rational humanism, and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual.",
            "And for the first time in history, you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius.",
            "And I got to tell you, I think that was a huge error.",
            "You know, I think that allowing somebody, one mere person to believe that he or she is like, the vessel, you know, like the font and the essence and the source of all divine, creative, unknowable, eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile, human psyche.",
            "It's like asking somebody to swallow the sun.",
            "It just completely warps and distorts egos, and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance.",
            "And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years.",
            "And, if this is true, and I think it is true, the question becomes, what now?",
            "Can we do this differently?",

            "I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone, who's now in her 90s, but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia, she would be out working in the fields, and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape.",
            "And she said it was like a thunderous train of air.",
            "And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape.",
            "And she felt it coming, because it would shake the earth under her feet.",
            "She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point, and that was to, in her words, \"run like hell.\"",
            "And she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem, and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her, she could collect it and grab it on the page.",
            "And other times she wouldn't be fast enough, so she'd be running and running and running, and she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape, looking, as she put it \"for another poet.\"",
            "And then there were these times -- this is the piece I never forgot -- she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it, right?",
            "So, she's running to the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her, and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her, and then she said, it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it.",
            "She would catch the poem by its tail, and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page.",
            "And in these instances, the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards, from the last word to the first.",
            "So when I heard that I was like -- that's uncanny, that's exactly what my creative process is like.",
            "That's not at all what my creative process is -- I'm not the pipeline!",
            "I'm a mule, and the way that I have to work is that I have to get up at the same time every day, and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly.",
            "But even I, in my mulishness, even I have brushed up against that thing, at times.",
            "And I would imagine that a lot of you have too.",
            "You know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify.",
            "And what is that thing?",
            "And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds, but, in fact, might actually keep us sane?",
            "And for me, the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that is the musician Tom Waits, who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment.",
            "And we were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist, trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses that were totally internalized.",
            "But then he got older, he got calmer, and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles he told me, and this is when it all changed for him.",
            "And he's speeding along, and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of melody, that comes into his head as inspiration often comes, elusive and tantalizing, and he wants it, you know, it's gorgeous, and he longs for it, but he has no way to get it.",
            "He doesn't have a piece of paper, he doesn't have a pencil, he doesn't have a tape recorder.",
            "So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like, \"I'm going to lose this thing, and then I'm going to be haunted by this song forever.",
            "I'm not good enough, and I can't do it.\"",
            "And instead of panicking, he just stopped.",
            "He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel.",
            "He just looked up at the sky, and he said, \"Excuse me, can you not see that I'm driving?\"",

            "And his whole work process changed after that.",
            "Not the work, the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever.",
            "But the process, and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie, the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble, and released it kind of back where it came from, and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized, tormented thing.",
            "It could be this peculiar, wondrous, bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between Tom and the strange, external thing that was not quite Tom.",
            "So when I heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too, and it already saved me once.",
            "This idea, it saved me when I was in the middle of writing \"Eat, Pray, Love,\" and I fell into one of those, sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster, this is going to be the worst book ever written.",
            "Not just bad, but the worst book ever written.",

            "They're able to be moved around by hand, they can sense each other, they can sense their motion, and they have a screen and a wireless radio.",
            "Most importantly, they're physical, so like the blocks, you can move them just by reaching out and grasping.",
            "And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information.",
            "And as these tools become more physical, more aware of their motion, aware of each other, and aware of the nuance of how we move them, we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles.",
            "So, I'm going to start with some simple examples.",
            "This Siftable is configured to show video, and if I tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way; if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards.",
            "And these interactive portraits are aware of each other.",
            "So if I put them next to each other, they get interested.",
            "If they get surrounded, they notice that too, they might get a little flustered.",
            "And they can also sense their motion and tilt.",
            "One of the interesting implications on interaction, we started to realize, was that we could use everyday gestures on data, like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid.",
            "So in this case, we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets and I can use them to pour color into that central one, where they get mixed.",
            "If we overshoot, we can pour a little bit back.",
            "There are also some neat possibilities for education, like language, math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly, and view the results immediately.",
            "So here I'm -- This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program.",
            "Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and Boggle.",
            "Basically, in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable, and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary.",
            "Then, after about 30 seconds, it reshuffles, and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try.",
            "Thank you.",
            "So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab, and I managed to get them to try it out, and shoot a video.",
            "They really loved it.",
            "And, one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions.",
            "All you have to say is, \"Make words,\" and they know exactly what to do.",
            "So here's another few people trying it out.",
            "That's our youngest beta tester, down there on the right.",
            "Turns out, all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up.",
            "So to him, they were just blocks.",
            "Now, this is an interactive cartoon application.",
            "And we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners.",
            "And this is Felix, actually.",
            "And he can bring new characters into the scene, just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them.",
            "Here, he's bringing the sun out.",
            "The sun is rising.",
            "Now he's brought a tractor into the scene.",
            "The orange tractor.",
            "Good job! Yeah!",
            "So by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- Woof!",
            "inventing his own narrative.",
            "Hello!",
            "It's an open-ended story, and he gets to decide how it unfolds.",
            "Fly away, cat.",
            "So, the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we've built recently, in which Siftables act as sounds like lead, bass and drums.",
            "Each of these has four different variations, you get to choose which one you want to use.",
            "And you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want.",
            "And you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable.",
            "There are effects that you can control live, like reverb and filter.",
            "You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it.",
            "And then, overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence.",
            "So let's have a look.",
            "We'll start by putting a lead into two sequence Siftables, arrange them into a series, extend it, add a little more lead.",
            "Now I put a bass line in.",
            "Now I'll put some percussion in.",
            "And now I'll attach the filter to the drums, so I can control the effect live.",
            "I can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo one way or the other.",
            "And now I'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression.",
            "I can rearrange the sequence while it plays.",
            "So I don't have to plan it out in advance, but I can improvise, making it longer or shorter as I go.",
            "And now, finally, I can fade the whole sequence out using the volume Siftable, tilted to the left.",
            "Thank you.",
            "So, as you can see, my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work.",
            "And today, I had time to show you one point in this new design space, and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory.",
            "So the thought I want to leave you with is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms.",
            "Thank you very much.",
            "I look forward to talking with all of you."

            "Avec des photos et des histoires passionnantes, l'explorateur du National Geographic Wade Davis rend hommage à l'extraordinaire diversité des cultures indigènes du monde, qui sont en voie de disparition sur notre planète à une vitesse alarmante.",
            "Vous savez, un des plaisirs intenses du voyage et un des délices de la recherche ethnographique est la possibilité de vivre parmi ceux qui n'ont pas oublié les anciennes coutumes, qui ressentent encore leur passé souffler dans le vent, qui le touchent dans les pierres polies par la pluie, le dégustent dans les feuilles amères des plantes.",
            "Le fait de savoir que les Jaguar shaman voyagent toujours au-delà de la voie lactée, ou que les mythes des anciens Inuit résonnent encore de sens, ou bien que dans l'Himalaya, les Bouddhistes continuent à rechercher le souffle du Dharma, c'est se rappeler de la révélation essentielle de l'anthropologie, et cela veut dire que le monde dans lequel nous vivons n'existe pas dans un sens absolu, mais est uniquement un exemple de réalité, la conséquence d'un ensemble spécifique de choix adaptés établis par notre lignée avec succès, il y a plusieurs générations.",
            "Bien sûr, nous partageons tous les mêmes impératifs d'adaptation.",
            "Nous sommes tous nés. Nous apportons nos enfants dans ce monde.",
            "Nous procédons à des rites d'initiations.",
            "Nous devons faire face à la séparation inexorable de la mort, cela ne devrait donc pas nous surprendre que nous chantions, nous dansions, nous sommes tous des artistes.",
            "Par contre, la cadence exceptionnelle de la chanson est intéressante, le rythme de la danse dans toutes les cultures.",
            "Et que ce soit le Penan dans les forêts du Bornéo, ou les acolytes Voodoo à Haïti, ou bien les guerriers dans le désert du Kaisut au nord du Kenya, le Curendero dans les montagnes des Andes, ou bien un caravansérail en plein milieu du Sahara. A propos, c'est la personne avec qui j'ai voyagé dans le désert il y un mois, ou effectivement, le gardien de troupeau de Yaks sur les flancs du Qomolangma, l'Everest, la déesse du monde.",
            "Tous ces peuples nous enseignent qu'il y a d'autres façons d'être, d'autres façons de penser, d'autres manières de s'orienter sur Terre.",
            "Et ceci est une idée, si on y réfléchit, qui ne peut que vous remplir d'espoir.",
            "Aujourd'hui, les innombrables cultures dans le monde constituent un tissu de vie spirituelle et culturelle qui enveloppe la planète, et qui est aussi important pour le bien-être de la planète que l'est également le tissu biologique de la vie que vous connaissez en tant que biosphère.",
            "Et vous pourriez considérer ce tissu culturel de la vie en tant qu'ethnosphère et vous pourriez définir l'ethnosphère comme étant la somme globale de toutes les pensées, les rêves, les mythes, les idées, les inspirations, les intuitions engendrées par l'imagination humaine depuis l'aube de la conscience.",
            "L'ethnosphère est l'héritage de l'humanité.",
            "C'est le symbole de tout ce que nous sommes et tout ce que nous pouvons être en tant qu'espèce dotée d'une curiosité stupéfiante.",
            "Et lorsque la biosphère fut sérieusement érodée, l'ethnosphère l'a été également -- et peut-être bien plus rapidement.",
            "Aucun biologiste, par exemple, n'oserait suggérer que 50% ou plus de toutes les espèces ont été ou sont à deux doigts de l'extinction parce que ce n'est tout simplement pas vrai, et pourtant -- que le scénario le plus apocalyptique dans le royaume de la diversité biologique -- se rapproche rarement de ce que nous considérons comme le scénario le plus optimiste au sein de la diversité culturelle.",
            "Et l'indicateur le plus fiable est bien sûr l'extinction du langage.",
            "Lorsque chacun d'entre vous dans cette salle est né, 6,000 langues étaient pratiquées sur la planète.",
            "De nos jours, une langue n'est pas uniquement un ensemble de vocabulaire ou bien un groupe de règles de grammaire.",
            "Une langue est une étincelle de l'esprit humain.",
            "C'est un véhicule à travers lequel l'âme de chaque culture spécifique entre dans le monde matériel.",
            "Chaque langue est une ancienne forêt de l'esprit, un partage, une pensée, un écosystème de possibilités spirituelles.",
            "Et parmi ces 6,000 langues, alors que nous sommes à Monterey aujourd'hui, une bonne moitié n'est plus chuchotée dans les oreilles des enfants.",
            "Elles ne sont plus enseignées aux bébés, ce qui veut effectivement dire qu'à moins qu'un changement ait lieu, elles sont déjà mortes.",
            "Comment ne pas se sentir seuls, enveloppés dans le silence, et être le dernier de votre peuple à parler votre langue, de n'avoir aucun moyen de transmettre la sagesse des ancêtres ou devancer la promesse des enfants ?",
            "Et pourtant, cette atroce fatalité est en effet le désespoir de quelqu'un quelque part sur terre, tous les quinze jours à peu près, parce que tous les quinze jours, un ancien meurt et emporte les dernières syllabes avec lui dans la tombe d'une langue ancienne.",
            "Et je sais que certains d'entre vous disent, \"Ne serait-il pas mieux ? Le monde ne serait-il pas un meilleur endroit si nous ne parlions qu'une seule langue ?\" Et je réponds, \"Bien, cette langue sera du Yoruba. Du Cantonais.",

            "Beaucoup d'entre nous oublient un peu que lorsque je dis \"des façons différentes d'être\", je veux vraiment dire des façons différentes d'être.",
            "Prenez, par exemple, cet enfant de Barasana dans le nord-ouest de l'amazonie, les peuples de l'anaconda qui croient selon la mythologie, qu'ils ont remonté la rivière de lait de l'est dans le ventre des serpents sacrés.",
            "C'est un peuple dont l'état des connaissances ne permet pas de faire la distinction entre la couleur bleue et verte parce que la canopée des cieux est égale à la canopée de la forêt dont le peuple dépend.",

            "Et tout ceci est la souche du passé mythologique, cependant, il est curieux que dans ces grandes maisons six ou sept langues sont parlées à cause du mariage consanguin. Vous n'entendez jamais une personne pratiquer une langue.",

            "Ou bien, une des tribus les plus fascinantes avec laquelle j'ai vécu, les Waorani du nord-est de l'Equateur, un peuple suprenant contacté en douceur en 1958.",
            "En 1957, cinq missionnaires ont tenté de rentrer en contact et ont commis une erreur cruciale.",
            "Ils ont fait tomber du ciel des photos brillantes, d'eux-mêmes, 8 par 10, ce que l'on pourrait qualifier de témoignage d'amitié, oubliant que ces peuples des forêts tropicales n'avaient jamais rien vu en 2 dimensions de leur vie.",
            "Ils ont ramassé ces photos tombées par terre, ont essayé de regarder derrière le visage pour distinguer une forme, une silhouette, n'ont rien trouvé et en ont déduit que c'était des cartes venant du diable. Ils ont donc abattu les cinq missionnaires à coups de lance.",
            "Mais, les Waorani n'abattaient pas seulement les étrangers.",
            "Ils se tuaient entre eux.",

            "Nous avons retracé la généalogie de huit générations, et nous avons découvert deux circonstances de mort naturelle et lorsque que nous avons obligé le peuple à en parler, ils ont avoué qu'un des compatriotes était si vieux qu'il est mort vieux, et nous l'avons abattu de toute façon.",
            "Cependant, ils avaient par la même occasion une connaissance perspicace de la forêt, qui était stupéfiante.",
            "Leurs chasseurs pouvaient sentir l'urine animale à 40 pas et vous dire de quelle espèce elle provenait.",
            "Dans les années '80, on m'avait confié une mission étonnante lorsque mon professeur de Harvard m'a demandé si cela m'intéressait d'aller à Haïti pour m'infiltrer dans les sociétés secrètes, le fondement de la force de Duvalier et de Tonton Macoutes, et de sécuriser le poison utilisé pour faire des zombies.",
            "Afin de rationnaliser cette sensation bien sûr, Il fallait que je comprenne cette remarquable foi de Vodoun, et le Voodoo n'est pas un culte de la magie noire.",
            "C'est au contraire, une vision métaphysique du monde.",

            "Le christianisme, l'islam, le bouddhisme, le judaïsme, peu importe.",
            "Il y a toujours un continent qui est exclu, en assumant que l'Afrique sub-Saharienne n'avait aucune croyance religieuse. Mais, bien sûr qu'ils en avaient et le Voodoo est simplement la distillation de ces idées religieuses très profondes qui surgirent lors de la tragique diaspora de l'ère de l'esclavage.",
            "Ce qui rend le Voodoo si intéressant c'est cette relation vivante entre les vivants et les morts.",
            "Les vivants donnent naissance aux esprits.",
            "Les esprits peuvent être appelés de la Grande Eau, répondant au rythme de la danse afin de déplacer momentanément l'esprit des vivants, et lors de ce bref instant radieux, l'acolyte devient le dieu.",
            "C'est pourquoi les Voodoo disent que \"Vous les blancs vous allez a l'église et parlez de Dieu.",
            "Nous dansons dans le temple et devenons Dieu.\"",
            "Et étant possédés, l'esprit prend le contrôle, comment pouvez-vous souffrir ?",
            "Vous voyez donc ces démonstrations étonnantes : Des acolytes Voodoo dans un état de trance manipulant des charbons ardents impunément, une démonstration plutôt surprenante des capacités avec lesquelles l'esprit affecte le corps qui le porte lorsqu'ils sont catalysés dans un état d'excitation extrême.",
            "De tous les peuples avec lesquels j'ai été, le plus extraordinaire sont les Kogi de la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta au nord de la Colombie.",
            "Descendants des anciennes civilisations tyranniques qui occupaient jadis la plaine côtière des Caraïbes de Colombie dans le sillage de la conquête, ce peuple s'est retiré dans un massif volcanique isolé qui s'élève au dessus de la plaine côtière des Caraïbes.",
            "Dans un continent tâché de sang, ce peuple n'a jamais été conquis par les Espagnols.",
            "A ce jour, ils sont dirigés par un clergé rituel cependant, leur formation au clergé est plutôt extraordinaire.",
            "Les jeunes acolytes sont enlevés à leurs familles à l'âge de trois ou quatre ans, ils sont séquestrés dans un monde sombre et obscur dans des huttes de pierres aux pieds des glaciers, pendant 18 ans. Deux périodes de neuf ans choisies délibérément afin d'imiter les neuf mois de gestation passés dans le ventre de leur mère naturelle, et ils sont maintenant dans le ventre de la grande mère, métaphoriquement parlant.",
            "Et pendant tout ce temps, les valeurs de leur société leur sont inculquées, valeurs qui appuient le fait que leurs prières et seulement leurs prières conservent l'équilibre de l'univers -- ce que nous appellerions l'équilibre écologique.",
            "Et au terme de cette stupéfiante initiation, ils en sortent un jour et pour la première fois dans leur vie, à l'âge de 18 ans, ils découvrent le lever du jour. Lors de ce moment de prise de conscience lumineuse de cette première lueur du soleil qui inonde les flancs de ce paysage d'une beauté éblouissante, et soudain, tout ce qu'ils apprirent de façon abstraite est concrétisé dans une gloire sensationnelle. Puis le prêtre fait un pas en arrière et dit, \"Tu vois ? C'est vraiment comme je te l'avais décrit.",
            "C'est aussi beau et c'est à toi de le protéger.\"",
            "Ils s'appellent les frères anciens et ils disent, nous, les jeunes frères, sommes responsables de la destruction du monde.",
            "Ce niveau d'intuition devient primordial.",
            "Chaque fois que nous pensons aux peuples indigènes et au paysage, soit nous évoquons Rousseau et la vieille idée du bon sauvage, une idée raciste dans sa simplicité, ou bien, nous évoquons Thoreau et nous disons que ce peuple est plus près de la Terre que nous le sommes.",
            "Eh bien, les indigènes ne sont ni sentimentaux ni affaiblis par la nostalgie.",
            "Il n'y a pas beaucoup de place pour les deux dans les marécages paludéens des Asmat ou dans les vents glacials du Tibet, mais ils ont, néanmoins, à travers le temps et les rituels, fabriqué une mystique traditionnelle de la Terre qui n'est pas basée sur le fait d'en être volontairement proche, mais basée sur une intuition beaucoup plus subtile : le fait que la Terre en elle-même ne puisse exister que par le biais de la conscience humaine.",
            "Qu'est-ce que cela veut dire ?",
            "Cela veut dire qu'un jeune enfant des Andes a qui on a enseigné que cette montagne est un esprit Apu qui décidera de sa destinée, deviendra un être humain complètement différent et aura un rapport différent avec cette ressource ou avec cet endroit qu'aurait un jeune enfant du Montana à qui on a enseigné qu'une montagne est un tas de pierres prêt à être exploité.",
            "Que ce soit la demeure d'un esprit ou un tas de minerai, est sans rapport.",
            "La métaphore est intéressante, définissant la relation entre l'individu et le monde naturel.",
            "J'ai grandi dans les forêts de British Columbia où on m'a enseigné que ces forêts existaient pour être coupées.",
            "Cela a fait de moi un être humain différent de mes amis les Kwakiutl qui croient que ces forêts sont la demeure de Hukuk et le bec courbé du ciel et les esprits cannibales qui demeuraient au nord du monde, esprits qu'ils devraient engager lors de leur initiation Hamatsa.",
            "Maintenant, si vous commencez à vous faire à l'idée que ces cultures peuvent créer des réalités différentes, vous pourriez commencer à comprendre certaines de leurs extraordinaires découvertes. Prenez cette plante par exemple.",
            "C'est une photo que j'ai prise au nord-ouest de l'Amazonie en avril dernier.",
            "C'est une ayahuasca, dont beaucoup d'entre vous ont entendu parler, la plus puissante préparation psychoactive du répertoire des shamans.",
            "Ce qui rend l'ayahuasca étonnante n'est pas simplement le potentiel pharmacologique de cette préparation, mais son élaboration. Elle est préparée à partir de deux sources différentes. D'un côté, il y a cette liane qui contient une série de béta-carbolines, harmine, harmaline, légèrement hallucinogènes. Consommer uniquement la plante grimpante c'est plutôt comme une fumée tel un nuage bleuté traversant votre conscience. Mais elle est mélangée aux feuilles d'un buisson de la famille du café appelées Psychotria viridis.",
            "Cette plante contenait de très puissantes tryptamines, très semblables à la sérotonine du cerveau, dimethyltriptamine, 5-methoxydimethyltriptamine.",
            "Si vous avez déjà vu les Yanomanö renifler ce tabac par le nez, cette substance qu'ils préparent à partir d'un ensemble d'espèces différentes, contient également de la methoxidimethyltriptamine.",
            "Avoir cette poudre remonter dans le nez c'est comme sortir d'un canon de fusil doublé de tableaux baroques et atterrissant sur une mer d'électricité.",
            "Elle ne provoque pas une déformation de la réalité ; mais plutôt une dissolution de la réalité.",
            "En fait, j'ai eu des discussions avec mon professeur, Richard Evan Shultes -- un homme qui a déclenché l'ère psychédélique suite à sa découverte des champignons magiques dans les années 1930 au Mexique. Je soutenais le fait qu'on ne pouvait pas classer ces tryptamines en tant qu'hallucinogène, puisqu'une fois qu'ils ont fait effet il n'y a plus personne à la maison pour faire une hallucination.",
            "Par contre les tryptamines ne peuvent pas être consommées par voie orale étant dénaturés par une enzyme se trouvant de façon naturelle dans l'intestin de l'homme : la monoamine-oxydase.",
            "Elles ne peuvent être consommées qu'oralement si elles sont prises en synergie avec un autre produit chimique qui dénature la MAO.",
            "Ce qu'il y a d'encore plus fascinant c'est que les béta-carbolines dont est composée la liane sont des inhibiteurs MAO d'un genre précis, nécessaires pour augmenter l'effet de la tryptamine. Donc, nous en venons à nous poser la question.",
            "Comment est-ce que dans une flore de 80,000 espèces de plantes astrictives, ces gens arrivent-ils à trouver ces deux plantes sans aucun lien morphologique qui lorsque mises en synergie de cette façon ont créé une sorte de version biochimique dont l'entité est plus importante que la somme des deux parties ?",
            "Eh bien, nous employons cet euphémisme, procéder par tâtonnements, qui est dénué de sens.",
            "Mais lorsqu'on demande aux Indiens, ils répondent : \"Les plantes nous parlent.\"",
            "Qu'est-ce que cela veut dire ?",
            "Cette tribu, les Cofan, possède 17 variétés de ayahuasca, qu'elle arrive à distinguer de loin dans la forêt, même si à nos yeux, elles semblent être de la même espèce.",
            "Puis, on leur demande comment ils définissent leur taxonomie et ils vous répondent: \"Je pensais que vous connaissiez les plantes.",
            "Vous n'y connaissez rien ?\". Je réponds: \"Non.\"",
            "En fait, vous prenez chacune des 17 variétés par une nuit de pleine lune, et la mélodie ne sera pas la même.",
            "Bien entendu, ce n'est pas comme ça que vous obtiendrez un doctorat de Harvard mais c'est bien plus intéressant que de compter des étamines.",
            "Maintenant, le problème-- le problème est que même ceux d'entre nous qui compatissons avec les difficultés du peuple indigène les considérons comme étant originaux et colorés mais quelque peu en marge de l'histoire alors que le vrai monde, c'est-à-dire notre monde, évolue.",
            "A vrai dire, dans 300 ans, le 20e siècle ne sera pas reconnu pour ses guerres ni pour ses innovations technologiques, mais plutôt comme une ère dans laquelle nous avons vécu et avons soit activement adhéré ou bien passivement accepté la destruction massive de la diversité biologique ainsi que culturelle sur la planète. Le problème aujourd'hui n'est pas le changement.",
            "Toutes les cultures à travers les temps ont constamment participé à une danse avec de nouvelles possibilités de vie.",
            "Et le problème n'est pas la technologie elle-même.",
            "Les Indiens Sioux n'ont pas cessé d'être des Sioux lorsqu'ils abandonnèrent l'arc et la flèche pas plus que les Américains n'étaient plus Américains dès lors qu'ils abandonnèrent le cheval et la charrette.",
            "Ce n'est pas le changement ou bien la technologie qui menace l'intégrité de l'ethnosphère. C'est le pouvoir. Le visage rustre de la domination.",
            "Et lorsque vous regardez dans le monde, vous découvrez que ce ne sont pas des cultures vouées à disparaître.
