            "Daniel Kahneman: The riddle of experience vs. memory",
            "Using examples from vacations to colonoscopies, Nobel laureate and founder of behavioral economics Daniel Kahneman reveals how our \"experiencing selves\" and our \"remembering selves\" perceive happiness differently. This new insight has profound implications for economics, public policy -- and our own self-awareness.",
            "Everybody talks about happiness these days.",
            "I had somebody count the number of books  with \"happiness\" in the title published in the last five years  and they gave up after about 40, and there were many more.",
            "There is a huge wave of interest in happiness,  among researchers.",
            "There is a lot of happiness coaching.",
            "Everybody would like to make people happier.",
            "But in spite of all this flood of work,  there are several cognitive traps  that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight  about happiness.",
            "And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps.",
            "This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness,  and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness,  because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is.",
            "The first of these traps  is a reluctance to admit complexity.",
            "It turns out that the word happiness  is just not a useful word anymore  because we apply it to too many different things.",
            "I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it  but, by and large,  this is something that we'll have to give up  and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view  of what well-being is.",
            "The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory:  basically it's between being happy in your life  and being happy about your life  or happy with your life.",
            "And those are two very different concepts,  and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness.",
            "And the third is the focusing illusion,  and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance  that affects well-being  without distorting its importance.",
            "I mean, this is a real cognitive trap.",
            "There's just no way of getting it right.",
            "Now, I'd like to start with an example  of somebody who had a question and answer session  after one of my lectures reported a story.",
            "He said he'd been listening to the symphony  and it was absolutely glorious music  and at the very end of the recording,  there was a dreadful screeching sound.",
            "And then he added, really quite emotionally,  it ruined the whole experience.",
            "But it hadn't.",
            "What it had ruined were the memories of the experience.",
            "He had had the experience.",
            "He had had 20 minutes of glorious music.",
            "They counted for nothing  because he was left with a memory;  the memory was ruined,  and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep.",
            "What this is telling us, really,  is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people  in terms of two selves.",
            "There is an experiencing self,  who lives in the present  and knows the present,  is capable of re-living the past,  but basically it has only the present.",
            "It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches --  you know, when the doctor asks,  \"Does it hurt now when I touch you here?\"",
            "And then there is a remembering self,  and the remembering self is the one that keeps score,  and maintains the story of our life,  and it's the one that the doctor approaches  in asking the question,  \"How have you been feeling lately?\"",
            "or \"How was your trip to Albania?\" or something like that.",
            "Those are two very different entities,  the experiencing self and the remembering self  and getting confused between them is part of the mess  of the notion of happiness.",
            "Now, the remembering self  is a storyteller.",
            "And that really starts with a basic response of our memories --  it starts immediately.",
            "We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories.",
            "Our memory tells us stories,  that is, what we get to keep from our experiences  is a story.",
            "And let me begin with one example.",
            "This is an old study.",
            "Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure.",
            "I won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days,  but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s.",
            "They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds.",
            "And here are two patients.",
            "Those are their recordings.",
            "And you are asked, \"Who of them suffered more?\"",
            "And it's a very easy question.",
            "Clearly, Patient B suffered more.",
            "His colonoscopy was longer,  and every minute of pain that Patient A had  Patient B had and more.",
            "But now there is another question:  \"How much did these patients think they suffered?\"",
            "And here is a surprise:  And the surprise is that Patient A  had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy  than Patient B.",
            "The stories of the colonoscopies were different  and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends --  and neither of these stories is very inspiring or great --  but one of them is this distinct ...",
            "but one of them is distinctly worse than the other.",
            "And the one that is worse  was the one where pain was at its peak at the very end.",
            "It's a bad story.",
            "How do we know that?",
            "Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy,  and much later, too,  \"How bad was the whole thing, in total?\"",
            "and it was much worse for A than for B in memory.",
            "Now this is a direct conflict  between the experiencing self and the remembering self.",
            "From the point of view of the experiencing self,  clearly, B had a worse time.",
            "Now, what you could do with patient A,  and we actually ran clinical experiments,  and it has been done, and it does work,  you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A  by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much.",
            "That will cause the patient  to suffer, but just a little  and much less than before.",
            "And if you do that for a couple of minutes,  you have made the experiencing self  of Patient A worse off,  and you have the remembering self of Patient A  and lot better off,  because now you have endowed Patient A  with a better story  about his experience.",
            "What defines a story?",
            "And that is true of the stories  that memory delivers for us,  and it's also true of the stories that we make up.",
            "What defines a story are changes,  significant moments and endings.",
            "Endings are very, very important  and, in this case, the ending dominated.",
            "Now, the experiencing self  lives its life continuously.",
            "It has moments of experience, one after the other.",
            "And you ask: What happens to these moments?",
            "And the answer is really straightforward.",
            "They are lost forever.",
            "I mean, most of the moments of our life --  and I calculated -- you know, the psychological present  is said to be about three seconds long.",
            "Which means that, you know,  in a life there, are about 600 million of them.",
            "In a month, there are about 600,000.",
            "Most of them don't leave a trace.",
            "Most of them are completely ignored  by the remembering self.",
            "And yet, some how you get the sense  that they should count,  that what happens during these moments of experience  is our life.",
            "It's the finite resource that we're spending  while we're on this earth.",
            "And how to spend it,  would seem to be relevant,  but that is not the story  that the remembering self keeps for us.",
            "So we have the remembering self  and the experiencing self,  and they're really quite distinct.",
            "The biggest difference between them  is in the handling of time.",
            "From the point of view of the experiencing self,  if you have a vacation,  and the second week is just as good as the first,  then the two week vacation  is twice as good as the one week vacation.",
            "That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self.",
            "For the remembering self, a two week vacation  is barely better than the one week vacation  because there are no new memories added.",
            "You have not changed the story.",
            "And in this way,  time is actually the critical variable  that distinguishes a remembering self  from an experiencing self.",
            "Time has very little impact on this story.",
            "Now, the remembering self does more  than remember and tell stories.",
            "It is actually the one that makes decisions  because, if you have a patient who has had, say,  two colonoscopies with two different surgeons  and is deciding which of them to choose,  then the one that chooses  is the one that has the memory that is less bad,  and that's the surgeon that will be chosen.",
            "The experiencing self  has no voice in this choice.",
            "We actually don't choose between experiences.",
            "we choose between memories of experiences.",
            "And, even when we think about the future,  we don't think of our future normally as experiences.",
            "We think of our future  as anticipated memories.",
            "And basically you can look at this,  you know, as a tyranny of the remembering self,  and you can think of the remembering self  sort of dragging the experiencing self  through experiences that  the experiencing self doesn't need.",
            "I have that sense that  when we go on vacations  this is very frequently the case,  that is, we go on vacations,  to a very large extent,  in the service of our remembering self.",
            "And this is a bit hard to justify I think.",
            "I mean, how much do we consume our memories?",
            "That is one of the explanations  that is given for the dominance  of the remembering self.",
            "And when I think about that, I think about a vacation  we had in Antarctica a few years ago,  which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had,  and I think of it relatively often,  relative to how much I think of other vacations.",
            "And I probably have consumed  my memories of that three week trip, I would say,  for about 25 minutes in the last four years.",
            "Now, if I had ever opened the folder  with the 600 pictures in it,  I would have spent another hour.",
            "Now, that is three weeks,  and that is at most an hour and a half.",
            "There seems to be a discrepancy.",
            "Now, I may be a bit extreme, you know,  in how little appetite I have for consuming memories,  but even if you do more of this,  there is a genuine question.",
            "Why do we put so much weight on memory  relative to the weight that we put on experiences?",
            "So I want you to think  about a thought experiment.",
            "Imagine that your next vacation  you know that at the end of the vacation  all your pictures will be destroyed,  and you'll get an amnesic drug  so that you won't remember anything.",
            "Now, would you choose the same vacation?",
            "And if you would choose a different vacation,  there is a conflict between your two selves,  and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict,  and it's actually not at all obvious because,  if you think in terms of time,  then you get one answer.",
            "And if you think in terms of memories,  you might get another answer.",
            "Why do we pick the vacations we do,  is a problem that confronts us  with a choice between the two selves.",
            "Now, the two selves  bring up two notions of happiness.",
            "There are really two concepts of happiness  that we can apply, one per self.",
            "So you can ask: How happy is the experiencing self?",
            "And then you would ask: How happy are the moments  in the experiencing self's life?",
            "And they're all -- happiness for moments  is a fairly complicated process.",
            "What are the emotions that can be measured?",
            "And, by the way, now we are capable  of getting a pretty good idea  of the happiness of the experiencing self over time.",
            "If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self,  it's a completely different thing.",
            "This is not about how happily a person lives.",
            "It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is  when that person thinks about her life.",
            "Very different notion.",
            "Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions,  is going to mess up the study of happiness,  and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being,  who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time  in precisely this way.",
            "The distinction between the  happiness of the experiencing self  and the satisfaction of the remembering self  has been recognized in recent years,  and there are now efforts to measure the two separately,  the Gallup Organization has a world poll  with more that half a million people  have been asked questions  about what they think of their life  and about their experiences.",
            "And there have been other efforts along those lines.",
            "So in recent years, we have begun to learn  about the happiness of the two selves.",
            "And the main lesson I think that we have learned,  is they are really different.",
            "You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life,  and that really doesn't teach you much  about how happily they're living their life,  and vice versa.",
            "Just to give you a sense of the correlation,  the correlation is about .5.",
            "What that means is if you met somebody,  and you were told, oh his father is six feet tall,  how much would you know about his height?",
            "Well, you would know something about his height,  but there's a lot of uncertainty.",
            "You have that much uncertainty.",
            "If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten,  you have a lot of uncertainty  about how happy they are  with their experiencing self.",
            "So the correlation is low.",
            "We know something about what controls  satisfaction of the happiness self.",
            "We know that money is very important,  goals are very important.",
            "We know that happiness is mainly  being satisfied with people that we like,  spending time with people that we like.",
            "There are other pleasures, but this is dominant.",
            "So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves,  you are going to end up  doing very different things.",
            "The bottom line of what I've said here  is that we really should not think of happiness  as a substitute for well-being.",
            "It is a completely different notion.",
            "Now, very quickly,  another reason we cannot think straight about happiness  is that we do not attend to the same things  when we think about life, and we actually live.",
            "So, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California,  you are not going to get to the correct answer.",
            "When you ask that question,  you think people must be happier in California,  if, say, you live in Ohio.",
            "And what happens is  when you think about living in California,  you are thinking of the contrast  between California and other places,  and that contrast, say, is in climate.",
            "Well, it turns out that climate  is not very important to the experiencing self  and is not even very important to the reflective self  that decides how happy people are.",
            "But now, because the reflective self is in charge,  you may end up -- some people may end up  moving to California.",
            "And it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen  to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier.",
            "Well, their experiencing self  is not going to get happier.",
            "We know that.",
            "But one thing will happen. They will think they are happier,  because, when they think about it,  they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio.",
            "And they will feel they made the right decision.",
            "It is very difficult  to think straight about well-being,  and I hope I have given you a sense  of how difficult it is.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you. I've got a question for you.",
            "Thank you so much.",
            "Now, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago,  you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result  came out of that Gallup survey.",
            "Is that something you can share  since you do have a few moments left now?",
            "Sure.",
            "I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey  is a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find.",
            "We found that with respect to the happiness  of the experiencing self.",
            "When we looked at how feelings  vary with income.",
            "And it turns out that, below an income  of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans,  and that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000,  but it's a large representative sample,  below an income of 600,000 dollars a year...",
            "60,000.",
            "60,000.",
            "60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy,  and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get.",
            "Above that, we get an absolutely flat line.",
            "I mean I've rarely seen lines so flat.",
            "Clearly, what is happening is  money does not buy you experiential happiness,  but lack of money certainly buys you misery,  and we can measure that misery  very, very clearly.",
            "In terms of the other self, the remembering self,  you get a different story.",
            "The more money you earn the more satisfied you are.",
            "That does not hold for emotions.",
            "But Danny, the whole American endeavor is about  life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.",
            "If people took seriously that finding,  I mean, it seems to turn upside down  everything we believe about, say for example,  taxation policy and so forth.",
            "Is there any chance that politicians, that the country generally,  would take a finding like that seriously  and run public policy based on it?",
            "You know I think that there is recognition  of the role of happiness research in public policy.",
            "The recognition is going to be slow in the United States,  no question about that,  but in the UK, it is happening,  and in other countries it is happening.",
            "People are recognizing that they ought  to be thinking of happiness  when they think of public policy.",
            "It's going to take awhile,  and people are going to debate  whether they want to study experience happiness,  or whether they want to study life evaluation,  so we need to have that debate fairly soon,  How to enhance happiness,  goes very different ways depending on how you think,  and whether you think of the remembering self  or you think of the experiencing self.",
            "This is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come.",
            "In the United States, efforts are being made  to measure the experience happiness of the population.",
            "This is going to be, I think, within the next decade or two,  part of national statistics.",
            "Well, it seems to me, this issue will, or at least should be,  the most interesting policy discussion to track  over the next few years.",
            "Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics.",
            "Thank you Danny Kahneman.",
            "Aimee Mullins: The opportunity of adversity",
            "The thesaurus might equate \"disabled\" with synonyms like \"useless\" and \"mutilated,\" but ground-breaking runner Aimee Mullins is out to redefine the word.

            "Certainly, from a medical standpoint,  my legs, laser surgery for vision impairment,  titanium knee and hip replacements for aging bodies  that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities,  and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them,  not to mention social networking platforms,  allow people to self-identify, to claim their own descriptions of themselves,  so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing.",
            "So, perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now  what has always been a truth,  that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society,  and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset.",
            "The human ability to adapt, it's an interesting thing,  because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity,  and I'm going to make an admission.",
            "This phrase never sat right with me,  and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it,  and I think I'm starting to figure out why.",
            "Implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity,  is the idea that success, or happiness,  is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience  unscathed or unmarked by the experience,  as if my successes in life have come about from an ability  to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics,  or what other people perceive as my disability.",
            "But, in fact, we are changed. We are marked, of course, by a challenge,  whether physically, emotionally or both.",

            "Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you  and how do we fix it, serves to be more disabling to the individual  than the pathology itself.",

            "So it's not about devaluing, or negating, these more trying times  as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug,  but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity.",
            "So maybe the idea I want to put out there is,  not so much overcoming adversity,  as it is opening ourselves up to it,  embracing it,  grappling with it,  to use a wrestling term,  maybe even dancing with it.",

            "And, perhaps, until we're tested, we don't know what we're made of.",
            "Maybe that's what adversity gives us,  a sense of self, a sense of our own power.",
            "So, we can give ourselves a gift.",

            "Maybe we can see it as change.",
            "Adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet.",
            "I think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves  is this idea of normalcy.",

(Warning: This talk is not suitable for viewers who are disturbed by needles or blood.)",
            "For some time I have been interested in  the placebo effect,  which might seem like an odd thing  for a magician to be interested in,  unless you think of it in the terms that I do,  which is \"something fake  is believed in enough by somebody  that it becomes something real.\"",

            "Someone who didn't have a childhood is out there.",

            "Maybe too much time, considering  how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world.",
            "But actually, according to my research,  at The Institute For The Future,  it's actually the opposite is true.",
            "Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough  game play to solve the world's most urgent problems.",
            "In fact, I believe that if we want to survive  the next century on this planet,  we need to increase that total dramatically.",
            "I've calculated the total we need  at 21 billion hours of game play every week.",
            "So, that's probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea,  so, I'll say it again, let it sink in.",
            "If we want to solve problems like hunger,  poverty, climate change, global conflict, obesity,  I believe that we need to aspire  to play games online  for at least 21 billion hours a week,  by the end of the next decade.",
            "No. I'm serious. I am.",
            "Here's why. This picture pretty much  sums up why I think games are so essential  to the future survival of the human species.  Truly.",
            "This is a portrait by a photographer named Phil Toledano.",
            "He wanted to capture the emotion of gaming.",
            "So, he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing.",
            "And this is a classic gaming emotion.",
            "Now, if you're not a gamer  you might miss some of the nuance in this photo.",
            "You probably see the sense of urgency,  a little bit of fear, but intense concentration,  deep deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem.",
            "If you are a gamer, you will notice  a few nuances here, the crinkle of the eyes up, and around the mouth  is a sign of optimism.",
            "And the eyebrows up is surprise.",
            "This is a gamer who is on the verge of something called  an epic win.",
            "Oh, you've heard of that. Okay. Good.",
            "So we have some gamers among us.",
            "An epic win is an outcome  that is so extraordinarily positive  you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it.",
            "It was almost beyond the threshold of imagination.",
            "And when you get there you are shocked  to discover what you are truly capable of. That is an epic win.",
            "This is a gamer on the verge of an epic win.",
            "And this is the face that we need to see  on millions of problem-solvers all over the world  as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century.",
            "The face of someone who, against all odds  is on the verge of an epic win.",
            "Now, unfortunately this is more of the face that we see  in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems.",
            "This is what I call the \"I'm Not Good At Life\" face.",
            "And this is actually me making it. Can you see? Yes. Good.",
            "This is actually me making the \"I'm Not Good At Life\" face.",
            "This is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood  in Berkeley, California, where I did my PhD  on why we're better in games than we are in real life.",
            "And this is a problem that a lot of gamers have.",
            "We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games.",
            "And I don't mean just good as in successful,  although that's part of it.",
            "We do achieve more in game worlds. But I also  but I also mean good as in  motivated to do something that matters,  inspired to collaborate and to cooperate.",
            "And when we're in game worlds  I believe that many of us become  the best version of ourselves, the most likely to help at a moment's notice,  the most likely to stick with a problem  as long at it takes, to get up after failure and try again.",
            "And in real life, when we face failure,  when we confront obstacles, we often don't feel that way.",
            "We feel overcome.",
            "We feel overwhelmed.",
            "We feel anxious, maybe depressed, frustrated or cynical.",
            "We never have those feelings when we're playing games,  they just don't exist in games.",
            "So, that's what I wanted to study  when I was a graduate student.",
            "What about games makes it impossible  to feel that we can't achieve everything?",
            "How can we take those feelings from games  and apply them to real-world work?",
            "So, I looked at games like World of Warcraft,  which is really the ideal collaborative problem solving environment.",
            "And I started to notice a few things  that make epic wins so possible in online worlds.",
            "So, the first thing is, whenever you show up in one of these online games  especially in World of Warcraft,  there are lots and lots of different characters  who are willing to trust you with a world-saving mission, right away.",
            "But not just any mission, it's a mission that is perfectly matched  with your current level in the game. Right?",
            "So, you can do it.",
            "They never give you a challenge that you can't achieve.",
            "But it is on the verge of what you're capable of. So, you have to try hard.",
            "But there is no unemployment in World of Warcraft.",
            "There is no sitting around wringing your hands.",
            "There is always something specific and important to be done.",
            "And there are also tons of collaborators.",
            "Everywhere you go, hundreds of thousands of people  ready to work with you  to achieve your epic mission.",
            "It's not something that we have in real life that easily,  this sense that at our fingertips  are tons of collaborators.",
            "And also there is this epic story, this inspiring story  of why we're there, and what we're doing.",
            "And then we get all this positive feedback.",
            "You guys have heard of leveling up and plus-one strength,  and plus-one intelligence.",
            "We don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life.",
            "When I get off this stage I'm not going to have  plus-one speaking, and plus-one crazy idea,  plus-20 crazy idea.",
            "I don't get that feedback in real life.",
            "Now, the problem with collaborative online environments  like World of Warcraft  is that it's so satisfying  to be on the verge of an epic win all the time,  that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds.",
            "It's just better than reality.",
            "So, so far, collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers  have spent 5.93 million years  solving the virtual problems of Azeroth.",
            "Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.",
            "It might sound like it's a bad thing.",
            "But to put that in context:  5.93 million years ago  was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up.",
            "That was the first upright primate.",
            "Okay, so when we talk about how much time we're currently investing  in playing games, the only way it makes sense  to even think about it, is to talk about time  at the magnitude of human evolution,  which is an extraordinary thing.",
            "But it's also apt. Because it turns out  that by spending all this time playing games,  we are actually changing what we  are capable of as human beings.",
            "We are evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species.",
            "This is true. I believe this.",
            "So, consider this really interesting statistic.",
            "It was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University.",
            "The average young person today  in a country with a strong gamer culture  will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games,  by the age of 21.",
            "Now 10,000 hours is a really  interesting number for two reasons.",
            "First of all, for children in the United States  10,080 hours is the exact amount of time  you will spend in school  from fifth grade to high school graduation  if you have perfect attendance.",
            "So, we have an entire  parallel track of education going on  where young people are learning as much about  what it takes to be a good gamer  as they are learning about everything else in school.",
            "And some of you have probably read  Malcom Gladwell's new book Outliers.",
            "So, you would have heard of his theory of success,  the 10,000 hour theory of success.",
            "It's based on this great cognitive science research  that if we can master 10,000 hours  at effortful study, at anything  by the age of 21, we will be virtuosos at it.",
            "We will be as good at whatever we do  as the greatest people in the world.",
            "And so, now what we're looking at  is an entire generation of young people  who are virtuoso gamers.",
            "So, the big question is,  \"What exactly are gamers getting so good at?\"",
            "Because if we could figure that out  we would have a virtually unprecedented  human resource on our hands.",
            "This is how many people we now have in the world  who spend at least an hour a day playing online games.",
            "These are our virtuoso gamers.",
            "500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something.",
            "And in the next decade  we're going to have another billion gamers  who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is.",
            "If you don't know it already, this is coming.",
            "The game industry is developing consoles  that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks  instead of broadband Internet  so that gamers all over the world,  particularly in India, China, Brazil, can get online.",
            "They expect one billion more gamers in the next decade.",
            "It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers.",
            "So, I've started to think about what these games  are making us virtuosos at.",
            "Here are the four things I came up with. The first is urgent optimism.",
            "Okay. Think of this as extreme self-motivation.",
            "Urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately  to tackle an obstacle,  combined with the belief  that we have a reasonable hope of success.",
            "Gamers always believe that an epic win is possible,  and that it is always worth trying, and trying now.",
            "Gamers don't sit around.",
            "Gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric.",
            "There is a lot of interesting research that shows  that we like people better after we play a game with them,  even if they've beaten us badly.",
            "And the reason is, it takes a lot of trust  to play a game with someone.",
            "We trust that they will spend their time with us,  that they will play by the same rules,  value the same goal, they'll stay with the game until it's over.",
            "And so, playing a game together actually builds up  bonds and trust and cooperation.",
            "And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result.",
            "Blissful productivity. I love it.",
            "You know there is a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer  plays for 22 hours a week,  kind of a half-time job.",
            "It's because we know, when we're playing a game,  that we're actually happier  working hard, than we are relaxing, or hanging out.",
            "We know that we are optimized, as human beings,  to do hard meaningful work.",
            "And gamers are willing to work hard  all the time, if they're given the right work.",
            "Finally, epic meaning.",
            "Gamers love to be attached to awe-inspiring missions  to human planetary-scale stories.",
            "So, just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective.",
            "So, you all know Wikipedia, biggest wiki in the world.",
            "Second biggest wiki, in the world, with nearly 80,000 articles  is the World of Warcraft wiki.",
            "Five million people use it every month.",
            "They have compiled more information about World of Warcraft  on the Internet than any other  topic covered on any other wiki in the world.",
            "They are building an epic story.",
            "They are building an epic knowledge resource  about the World of Warcraft.",
            "Okay, so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing.",
            "Gamers are super-empowered hopeful individuals.",
            "These are people who believe that they are individually capable  of changing the world.",
            "And the only problem is that they believe  that they are capable of changing virtual worlds  and not the real world.",
            "That's the problem that I'm trying to solve.",
            "There is an economist named Edward Castronova.",
            "His work is brilliant. He looks at why  people are investing so much time and energy  and money, in online worlds.",
            "And he says, \"We're witnessing what amounts  to no less than a mass exodus  to virtual worlds and online game environments.\"",
            "And he's an economist. So, he's rational.",
            "And he says ...",
            "Not like me -- I'm a game designer; I'm exuberant.",
            "But he says,  that this makes perfect sense,  because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life.",
            "They can have stronger social relationships  in games than they can have in real life.",
            "They get better feedback and feel more rewarded  in games than they do in real life.",
            "So, he says for now it makes perfect sense  for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world.",
            "Now, I also agree that that is rational, for now.",
            "But it is not, by any means, an optimal situation.",
            "We have to start making the real world more like a game.",
            "So, I take my inspiration from something that happened  2,500 years ago.",
            "These are ancient dice, made out of sheep's knuckles. Right?",
            "Before we had awesome game controlers  we had sheep's knuckles.",
            "And these represent the first game equipment  designed by human beings.",
            "And if you're familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian,  Herodotus, you might know this history.",
            "Which is the history of  who invented games and why.",
            "Herodotus says that games, particularly dice games  were invented in the kingdom of Lydia  during a time of famine.",
            "Apparently, there was such a severe famine,  that the king of Lydia decided that they had to do something crazy.",
            "People were suffering. People were fighting.",
            "It was an extreme situation. They needed  an extreme solution.",
            "So, according to Herodotus, they invented dice games  and they set up a kingdom-wide policy.",
            "On one day, everybody would eat.",
            "And on the next day, everybody would play games.",
            "And they would be so immersed in playing the dice games  because games are so engaging,  and immerse us in such satisfying blissful productivity,  they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat.",
            "And then on the next day, they would play games.",
            "And on the next day they would eat.",
            "And according to Herodotus,  they passed 18 years this way,  surviving through a famine,  by eating on one day, and playing games on the next.",
            "Now, this is exactly, I think,  how we're using games today.",
            "We're using games to escape real-world suffering.",
            "We're using games to get away from everything that's broken  in the real environment, everything that's not satisfying about real life,  and we're getting what we need from games.",
            "But it doesn't have to end there.",
            "This is really exciting.",
            "According to Herodotus, after 18 years  the famine wasn't getting better,  So, the king decided they would play one final dice game.",
            "They divided the entire kingdom in half.",
            "They played one dice game,  and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure.",
            "They would leave Lydia,  And they would go out in search of a new place to live,  leaving behind just enough people  to survive on the resources that were available,  and hopefully to take the civilization  somewhere else where they could thrive.",
            "Now, this sounds crazy, right?",
            "But recently, DNA evidence  has shown that the Etruscans,  who lead to the Roman empire,  actually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians.",
            "And so, recently, scientists have suggested  that Herodotus's crazy story is actually true.",
            "And geologists have found evidence  of a global cooling that lasted  for nearly 20 years that could have explained the famine.",
            "So, this crazy story might be true.",
            "They might have actually  saved their culture by playing games,  escaping to games for 18 years  and then been so inspired,  and knew so much about how to come together with games,  that they actually saved the entire civilization that way.",
            "Okay, we can do that.",
            "We've been playing Warcraft since 1994.",
            "That was the first real-time strategy game  from the World of Warcraft series. That was 16 years ago.",
            "They played dice games for 18 years,  we've been playing Warcraft for 16 years.",
            "I say we are ready for our own epic game.",
            "Now, they had half the civilization  go off in search of a new world.",
            "So, that's where I get my 21 billion hours a week of game-play from.",
            "Let's get half of us to agree  to spend an hour a day playing games,  until we solve real-world problems.",
            "Now, I know you're asking, \"How are we going to solve real world problems  in games?\" Well, that's what I have devoted my work to  over the past few years,  at The Institute For The Future.",
            "We have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto,  and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future.",
            "We do not want to try to predict the future.",
            "What we want to do is make the future.",
            "We want to imagine the best case scenario outcome  And then we want to empower people  to make that outcome a reality.",
            "We want to imaging epic wins,  and then give people the means to achieve the epic win.",
            "I'm just going to very briefly show you three games that I've made  that are an attempt to give people the means  to create epic wins in their own futures.",
            "So, this is World Without Oil.",
            "We made this game in 2007.",
            "This is an online game in which you try to survive  an oil shortage.",
            "The oil shortage is fictional,  but we put enough online content out there  for you to believe that it's real, and to live your real life  as if we've run out of oil. So, when you come to the game  you sign up, you tell us where you live.",
            "And then we give you real-time news videos  data feeds that show you  exactly how much oil costs,  what's not available, how food supply is being affected,  how transportation is being affected,  if schools are closed, if their is rioting.",
            "And you have to figure out how you would live your real life  as if this were true. And then we ask you to blog about it,  to post videos, to post photos.",
            "We piloted this game with 1,700 players in 2007.",
            "And we've tracked them for the three years since.",
            "And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience.",
            "Nobody wants to change how they live  just because it's good for the world, or because we are supposed to.",
            "But if you immerse them in an epic adventure  and tell them, \"We've run out of oil.\"",
            "This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on.",
            "Challenge yourself to see how you would survive.",
            "Most of our players have kept up the habits  that they learned in this game.",
            "So, for the next world-saving game,  we decided to aim higher, bigger problem than just peak oil.",
            "We did a game called Superstruct  at The Institute For The Future.",
            "And the premise was, a supercomputer has calculated  that humans have only 23 years left on the planet.",
            "This supercomputer was called the Global Extinction  Awareness System, of course.",

            "But in our game, instead of just having five people  on the dream team, we said everybody is on the dream team,  and it's your job to invent the future of energy,  the future of food, the future of health,  the future of security and the future of the social safety net.",
            "We had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks.",

            "We've got all these amazing gamers,  we've got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do,  but none of them have saved the real world yet.",
            "Well I hope that you will agree with me  that gamers are a human resource  that we can use to do real-world work,  that games are a powerful platform for change.",

            "But energy and climate are extremely important to these people,  in fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet.",
            "The climate getting worse, means that many years their crops won't grow.",
            "There will be too much rain, not enough rain.",
            "Things will change in ways  that their fragile environment simply can't support.",
            "And that leads to starvation. It leads to uncertainty. It leads to unrest.",
            "So, the climate changes will be terrible for them.",
            "Also, the price of energy is very important to them.",
            "In fact, if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of,  to reduce poverty, by far, you would pick energy.",
            "Now, the price of energy has come down over time.",
            "Really, advanced civilization is based on advances in energy.",
            "The coal revolution fueled the industrial revolution,  and, even in the 1900's we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity,  and that's why we have refrigerators, air-conditioning,  we can make modern materials and do so many things.",
            "And so, we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world.",
            "But, as we make it cheaper -- and let's go for making it twice as cheap --  we need to meet a new constraint,  and that constraint has to do with CO2.",
            "CO2 is warming the planet,  and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one.",
            "If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted,  that leads to a temperature increase,  and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects.",
            "The effects on the weather and, perhaps worse, the indirect effects,  in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes,  and so you get ecosystem collapses.",
            "Now, the exact amount of how you map  from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be  and where the positive feedbacks are,  there's some uncertainty there, but not very much.",
            "And there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be,  but they will be extremely bad.",
            "I asked the top scientists on this several times,  do we really have to get down to near zero?",
            "Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter?",
            "And the answer is that, until we get near to zero,  the temperature will continue to rise.",
            "And so that's a big challenge.",
            "It's very different than saying we're a 12 ft high truck trying to get under a 10 ft bridge,  and we can just sort of squeeze under.",
            "This is something that has to get to zero.",
            "Now, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year,  over 26 billion tons.",
            "For each American, it's about 20 tons.",
            "For people in poor countries, it's less than one ton.",
            "It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet.",
            "And, somehow, we have to make changes  that will bring that down to zero.",
            "It's been constantly going up.",
            "It's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all,  so we have to go from rapidly rising  to falling, and falling all the way to zero.",
            "This equation has four factors.",
            "A little bit of multiplication.",
            "So, you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero,  and that's going to be based on the number of people,  the services each person's using on average,  the energy on average for each service,  and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.",
            "So, let's look at each one of these  and see how we can get this down to zero.",
            "Probably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.",
            "Now that's back from high school algebra,  but let's take a look.",
            "First we've got population.",
            "Now, the world today has 6.8 billion people.",
            "That's headed up to about nine billion.",
            "Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines,  health care, reproductive health services,  we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent,  but there we see an increase of about 1.3.",
            "The second factor is the services we use.",
            "This encompasses everything,  the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating.",
            "These are very good things,  and getting rid of poverty means providing these services  to almost everyone on the planet.",
            "And it's a great thing for this number to go up.",
            "In the rich world, perhaps the top one billion,  we probably could cut back and use less,  but every year, this number, on average, is going to go up,  and so, over all, that will more than double  the services delivered per person.",
            "Here we have a very basic service.",
            "Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework,  and, in fact, these kids don't, so they're going out  and reading their school work under the street lamps.",
            "Now, efficiency, E, the energy for each service,  here, finally we have some good news.",
            "We have something that's not going up.",
            "Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting,  through different types of cars, different ways of building buildings.",
            "there are a lot of services where you can bring  the energy for that service down quite substantially,  some individual services even, bring it down by 90 percent.",
            "There are other services like how we make fertilizer,  or how we do air transport,  where the rooms for improvement are far, far less.",
            "And so, overall here, if we're optimistic,  we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even, perhaps, a factor of six.",
            "But for these first three factors now,  we've gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons,  and that just won't cut it.",
            "So let's look at this fourth factor --  this is going to be a key one --  and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy.",
            "And so the question is, can you actually get that to zero?",
            "If you burn coal, no.",
            "If you burn natural gas, no.",
            "Almost every way we make electricity today,  except for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out CO2.",
            "And so, what we're going to have to do at a global scale,  is create a new system.",
            "And so, we need energy miracles.",
            "Now, when I use the term miracle, I don't mean something that's impossible.",
            "The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle.",
            "The internet and its services are a miracle.",
            "So, the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles.",
            "Usually, we don't have a deadline,  where you have to get the miracle by a certain date.",
            "Usually, you just kind of stand by, and some come along, some don't.",
            "This is a case where we actually have to drive full speed  and get a miracle in a pretty tight time line.",
            "Now, I thought, how could I really capture this?",
            "Is there some kind of natural illustration,  some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here?",
            "I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitos,  and somehow people enjoyed that.",
            "It really got them involved in the idea of,  you know, there are people who live with mosquitos.",
            "So, with energy, all I could come up with is this.",
            "I decided that releasing fireflies  would be my contribution to the environment here this year.",
            "So here we have some natural fireflies.",
            "I'm told they don't bite, in fact, they might not even leave that jar.",
            "Now, there's all sorts gimmicky solutions like that one,  but they don't really add up to much.",
            "We need solutions, either one or several,  that have unbelievable scale  and unbelievable reliability,  and, although there's many directions people are seeking,  I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers.",
            "I've left out tide, geothermal, fusion, biofuels.",
            "Those may make some contribution,  and if they can do better than I expect, so much the better,  but my key point here  is that we're going to have to work on each of these five,  and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting,  because they all have significant challenges.",
            "Let's look first at the burning fossil fuels,  either burning coal or burning natural gas.",
            "What you need to do there, seems like it might be simple, but it's not,  and that's to take all the CO2, after you've burned it, going out the flue,  pressurize it, create a liquid, put it somewhere,  and hope it stays there.",
            "Now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level,  but getting up to that full percentage, that will be very tricky,  and agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard,  but the toughest one here is this long term issue.",
            "Who's going to be sure?",
            "Who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger  than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things?",
            "This is a lot of volume.",
            "So that's a tough one.",
            "Next, would be nuclear.",
            "It also has three big problems.",
            "Cost, particularly in highly regulated countries, is high.",
            "The issue of the safety, really feeling good about nothing could go wrong,  that, even though you have these human operators,  that the fuel doesn't get used for weapons.",
            "And then what do you do with the waste?",
            "And, although it's not very large, there are a lot of concerns about that.",
            "People need to feel good about it.",
            "So three very tough problems that might be solvable,  and so, should be worked on.",
            "The last three of the five, I've grouped together.",
            "These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources.",
            "And they actually -- although it's great they don't require fuel --  they have some disadvantages.",
            "One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies  is dramatically less than a power plant.",
            "This is energy farming, so you're talking about many square miles,  thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant.",
            "Also, these are intermittent sources.",
            "The sun doesn't shine all day, it doesn't shine every day,  and, likewise, the wind doesn't blow all the time.",
            "And so, if you depend on these sources,  you have to have some way of getting the energy  during those time periods that it's not available.",
            "So, we've got big cost challenges here.",
            "We have transmission challenges.",
            "For example, say this energy source is outside your country,  you not only need the technology,  but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere.",
            "And, finally, this storage problem.",
            "And, to dimensionalize this, I went through and looked at  all the types of batteries that get made,  for cars, for computers, for phones, for flashlights, for everything,  and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses,  and what I found is that all the batteries we make now  could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy.",
            "And so, in fact, we need a big breakthrough here,  something that's going to be a factor of a hundred better  than the approaches we have now.",
            "It's not impossible, but it's not a very easy thing.",
            "Now, this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source  to be above, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you're using.",
            "If you're counting on it for 100 percent,  you need an incredible miracle battery.",
            "Now, how we're going to go forward on this: what's the right approach?",
            "Is it a Manhattan project? What's the thing that can get us there?",
            "Well, we need lots of companies working on this, hundreds.",
            "In each of these five paths, we need at least a hundred people.",
            "And a lot of them, you'll look at and say they're crazy. That's good.",
            "And, I think, here in the TED group,  we have many people who are already pursuing this.",
            "Bill Gross has several companies, including one called eSolar  that has some great solar thermal technologies.",
            "Vinod Khosla's investing in dozens of companies  that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities,  and I'm trying to help back that.",
            "Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company  that, perhaps surprisingly, is actually taking the nuclear approach.",
            "There are some innovations in nuclear: modular, liquid.",
            "And innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago,  so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising.",
            "The idea of Terrapower is that, instead of burning a part of uranium,  the one percent, which is the U235,  we decided, let's burn the 99 percent, the U238.",
            "It is kind of a crazy idea.",
            "In fact, people had talked about it for a long time,  but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not,  and so it's through the advent of modern supercomputers  that now you can simulate and see that, yes,  with the right material's approach, this looks like it would work.",
            "And, because you're burning that 99 percent,  you have greatly improved cost profile.",
            "You actually burn up the waste, and you can actually use as fuel  all the leftover waste from today's reactors.",
            "So, instead of worrying about them, you just take that. It's a great thing.",
            "It breathes this uranium as it goes along. So it's kind of like a candle.",
            "You can see it's a log there, often referred to as a traveling wave reactor.",
            "In terms of fuel, this really solves the problem.",
            "I've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky.",
            "This is the left over, the 99 percent,  where they've taken out the part they burn now,  so it's called depleted uranium.",
            "That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years.",
            "And, simply by filtering sea water in an inexpensive process,  you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet.",
            "So, you know, it's got lots of challenges ahead,  but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas  that we need to move forward.",
            "So let's think, how should we measure ourselves?",
            "What should our report card look like?",
            "Well, let's go out to where we really need to get,  and then look at the intermediate.",
            "For 2050, you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction.",
            "That really is very important, that we get there.",
            "And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries,  still some agriculture.",
            "Hopefully, we will have cleaned up forestry, cement.",
            "So, to get to that 80 percent,  the developed countries, including countries like China,  will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether.",
            "So, the other grade is, are we deploying this zero-emission technology,  have we deployed it in all the developed countries  and we're in the process of getting it elsewhere.",
            "That's super important.",
            "That's a key element of making that report card.",
            "So, backing up from there, what should the 2020 report card look like?",
            "Well, again, it should have the two elements.",
            "We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions.",
            "The less we emit, the less that sum will be of CO2,  and, therefore, the less the temperature.",
            "But in some ways, the grade we get there,  doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions,  is only equally, or maybe even slightly less, important than the other,  which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs.",
            "These breakthroughs, we need to move those at full speed,  and we can measure that in terms of companies,  pilot projects, regulatory things that have been changed.",
            "There's a lot of great books that have been written about this.",
            "The Al Gore book, \"Our Choice\"  and the David McKay book, \"Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air.\"",
            "They really go through it and create a framework  that this can be discussed broadly,  because we need broad backing for this.",
            "There's a lot that has to come together.",
            "So this is a wish.",
            "It's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology.",
            "If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years,  I could pick who's president,  I could pick a vaccine, which is something I love,  or I could pick that this thing  that's half the cost with no CO2 gets invented,  this is the wish I would pick.",
            "This is the one with the greatest impact.",
            "If we don't get this wish,  the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible,  between the U.S. and China, between poor countries and rich,  and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse.",
            "So, what do we have to do?",
            "What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive?",
            "We need to go for more research funding.",
            "When countries get together in places like Copenhagen,  they shouldn't just discuss the CO2.",
            "They should discuss this innovation agenda,  and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending  on these innovative approaches.",
            "We do need the market incentives, CO2 tax, cap and trade,  something that gets that price signal out there.",
            "We need to get the message out.",
            "We need to have this dialogue be a more rational, more understandable dialogue,  including the steps that the government takes.",
            "This is an important wish, but it is one I think we can achieve.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you. Thank you.",
            "Thank you. Just so I understand more about Terrapower, right --  I mean, first of all, can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is?",
            "To actually do the software, buy the supercomputer,  hire all the great scientists, which we've done,  that's only tens of millions,  and even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor  to make sure our materials work properly,  then you'll only be up in the hundreds of millions.",
            "The tough thing is building the pilot reactor,  finding the several billion, finding the regulator, the location  that will actually build the first one of these.",
            "Once you get the first one built, if it works as advertised,  then it's just clear as day, because the economics, the energy density,  are so different than nuclear as we know it.",
            "And so, to understand it right, this involves building deep into the ground  almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel,  of this sort of spent uranium,  and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down?",
            "That's right. Today, you're always refueling the reactor,  so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong,  that thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out.",
            "That's not good.",
            "So, if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in --  just think of it as a log --  put it down and not have those same complexities.",
            "And it just sits there and burns for the sixty years, and then it's done.",
            "It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution.",
            "Yeah. Well, what happens with the waste,  you can let it sit there -- there's a lot less waste under this approach --  then you can actually take that,  and put it into another one and burn that.",
            "And we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today,  that's sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactor.",
            "That's our fuel to begin with.",
            "So, the thing that's been a problem from those reactors  is actually what gets fed into ours,  and you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically  as you're going through this process.",
            "But in your talking to different people around the world  about the possibilities here,  where is there most interest in actually doing something with this?",
            "Well, we haven't picked a particular place,  and there's all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that's called nuclear,  so we've got a lot of interest,  that people from the company have been in Russia, India, China.",
            "I've been back seeing the secretary of energy here,  talking about how this fits into the energy agenda.",
            "So I'm optimistic. You know the French and Japanese have done some work.",
            "This is a variant on something that has been done.",
            "It's an important advance, but it's like a fast reactor,  and a lot of countries have built them,  so anybody who's done a fast reactor, is a candidate to be where the first one gets built.",
            "So, in your mind, timescale and likelihood  of actually taking something like this live?",
            "Well, we need, for one of these high-scale, electro-generation things  that's very cheap,  we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy.",
            "That's sort of the deadline that the environmental models  have shown us that we have to meet.",
            "And, you know, Terrapower, if things go well, which is wishing for a lot,  could easily meet that.",
            "And there are, fortunately now, dozens of companies,  we need it to be hundreds,  who, likewise, if their science goes well,  if the funding for their pilot plants goes well,  that they can compete for this.",
            "And it's best if multiple succeed,  because then you could use a mix of these things.",
            "We certainly need one to succeed.",
            "In terms of big-scale possible game changes,  is this the biggest that you're aware of out there?",
            "An energy breakthrough is the most important thing.",
            "It would have been, even without the environmental constraint,  but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater.",
            "In the nuclear space, there are other innovators.",
            "You know, we don't know their work as well as we know this one,  but the modular people, that's a different approach.",
            "There's a liquid type reactor, which seems a little hard,  but maybe they say that about us.",
            "And so, there are different ones,  but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium  has a million times as much energy as a molecule of, say, coal,  and so, if you can deal with the negatives,  which are essentially the radiation,  the footprint and cost, the potential,  in terms of effect on land and various things,  is almost in a class of its own.",
            "If this doesn't work, then what?",
            "Do we have to start taking emergency measures  to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable?",
            "If you get into that situation,  it's like if you've been over-eating, and you're about to have a heart-attack.",
            "Then where do you go? You may need heart surgery or something.",

            "Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms  with his amazing specials that showed us  animals and places and a wondrous world  that we could never really have previously imagined.",
            "So, that seemed to resonate  with the whole science fiction part of it.",
            "And I was an artist.",
            "I could draw. I could paint.",
            "And I found that because there weren't video games  and this saturation of CG movies and all of this  imagery in the media landscape,  I had to create these images in my head.",
            "You know, we all did, as kids having to  read a book, and through the author's description  put something on the movie screen in our heads.",
            "And so, my response to this was to paint, to draw  alien creatures, alien worlds,  robots, spaceships, all that stuff.",
            "I was endlessly getting busted in math class  doodling behind the textbook.",
            "That was, the creativity  had to find its outlet somehow.",
            "And an interesting thing happened, the Jacques Cousteau shows  actually got me very excited about the fact that there was  an alien world right here on Earth.",
            "I might not really go to an alien world  on a spaceship someday.",
            "That seemed pretty darn unlikely.",
            "But that was a world I could really go to,  right here on Earth, that was as rich and exotic  as anything that I had imagined  from reading these books.",
            "So, I decided I was going to become a scuba diver  at the age of 15.",
            "And the only problem with that was that I lived  in a little village in Canada,  600 miles from the nearest ocean.",
            "But I didn't let that daunt me.",
            "I pestered my father until he finally found  a scuba class in Buffalo, New York,  right across the border from where we live.",
            "And I actually got certified  in a pool in a YMCA in the dead of winter  in Buffalo, New York.",
            "And I didn't see the ocean, a real ocean,  for another two years,  until we moved to California.",
            "Since then, in the intervening  40 years,  I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater,  And 500 hours of that was in submersibles.",
            "And I've learned that that deep ocean environment,  and even the shallow oceans,  are so rich with amazing life  that really is beyond our imagination.",
            "Nature's imagination is so boundless  compared to our own  meager human imagination.",
            "I still, to this day, stand in absolute awe  of what I see when I make these dives.",
            "And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing,  and just as strong as it ever was.",
            "But, when I chose a career, as an adult,  it was film making.",
            "And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile  this urge I had to tell stories,  with my urges to create images.",
            "And I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on.",
            "So, film making was the way to put pictures and stories  together. And that made sense.",
            "And of course the stories that I chose to tell  were science fiction stories: \"Terminator,\" \"Aliens,\"  and \"The Abyss.\"",
            "And with \"The Abyss,\" I was putting together my love  of underwater and diving, with film making.",
            "So, you know, merging the two passions.",
            "Something interesting came out of \"The Abyss,\"  which was that to solve a specific narrative  problem on that film,  which was to create this kind of liquid water creature,  we actually embraced computer generated animation, CG.",
            "And this resulted in the first soft-surface  character, CG animation  that was ever in a movie.",
            "And even though the film didn't make any money,  barely broke even, I should say,  I witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience,  the global audience, was mesmerized  by this apparent magic.",
            "You know, it's Arthur Clarke's law  that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.",
            "They were seeing something magical.",
            "And so that got me very excited.",
            "And I thought, \"Wow, this is something that needs to be embraced  into the cinematic art.\"",
            "So, with \"Terminator 2,\" which was my next film,  we took that much farther.",
            "Working with ILM, we created the liquid metal dude  in that film. the success hung in the balance  on whether that effect would work.",
            "And it did. And we created magic again.",
            "And we had the same result with an audience.",
            "Although we did make a little more money on that one.",
            "So, drawing a line through those two dots  of experience,  came to, this is going to be a whole new world,  this was a whole new world of creativity  for film artists.",
            "So, I started a company with Stan Winston,  my good friend Stan Winston,  who is the premier make-up and creature designer  at that time, and it was called Digital Domain.",
            "And the concept of the company was  that we would leap-frog past  the analog processes of optical printers and so on,  and we would go right to digital production.",
            "And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while.",
            "But we found ourselves lagging in the mid '90s  in the creature and character design stuff  that we had actually founded the company to do.",
            "So, I wrote this piece called \"Avatar,\"  which was meant to absolutely push the envelope  of visual effects,  of CG effects, beyond,  with realistic human emotive characters  generated in CG  And the main characters would all be in CG  And the world would be in CG  And the envelope pushed back.",
            "And I was told by the folks at my company  that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while.",
            "So, I shelved it, and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks.",
            "You know, I went and pitched it to the studio as \"'Romeo and Juliet' on a ship.\"",
            "It's going to be this epic romance,  passionate film.",
            "Secretly, what I wanted to do was  I wanted to dive to the real wreck of \"Titanic.\"",
            "And that's why I made the movie.",
            "And that's the truth. Now, the studio didn't know that.",
            "But I convinced them. I said,  \"We're going to dive to the wreck. We're going to film it for real.",
            "We'll be using it in the opening of the film.",
            "It will be really important. It will be a great marketing hook.\"",
            "And I talked them into funding an expedition.",
            "Sounds crazy. But this goes back to that theme about  about your imagination creating a reality.",
            "Because we actually created a reality where six months later  I find myself in a Russian submersible  two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic,  looking at the real Titanic through a view port,  not a movie, not HD, for real.",
            "Now, that blew my mind.",
            "And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build cameras  and lights and all kinds of things.",
            "But, it struck me how much  this dive, these deep dives  was like a space mission.",
            "You know, where it was highly technical,  and it required enormous planning.",
            "You get in this capsule, you go down to this dark  hostile environment  where there is no hope of rescue  if you can't get back by yourself.",
            "And I thought like, \"Wow. I am like  living in a science fiction movie.",
            "This is really cool.\"",
            "And so, I really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration.",
            "Of course, the curiosity, the science component of it.",
            "It was everything. It was adventure,  It was curiosity. It was imagination.",
            "And it was an experience that  Hollywood couldn't give me.",
            "Because, you know, I could imagine a creature and we could  create a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing  out that window.",
            "As we did some of our subsequent expeditions  I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents  and sometimes things that I had never seen before,  sometimes things that no one had seen before,  that actually were not described by science  at the time that we saw them and imaged them.",
            "So, I was completely smitten by this,  and had to do more.",
            "And so, I actually made a kind of curious decision.",
            "After the success of \"Titanic,\"  I said, \"Okay, I'm going to park my day job  as a Hollywood movie maker,  and I'm going to go be a full time explorer for a while.\"",
            "And so, we started planning these  expeditions.",
            "And we wound up going to the Bismark,  and exploring it with robotic vehicles.",
            "We went back to the Titanic wreck.",
            "We took little bots that we had created  that spooled a fiber optic.",
            "And the idea was to go in and do an interior  survey of that ship, which had never been done.",
            "Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck. They didn't have the means to do it,  so we created technology to do it.",
            "So, you know, here I am now, on the deck  of Titanic, sitting in a submersible,  and looking out at planks that look much like this,  where I knew that the band had played.",
            "And I'm flying a little robotic vehicle  through the corridor of the ship.",
            "When I say, I'm operating it,  but my mind is in the vehicle.",
            "I felt like I was physically present  inside the shipwreck of Titanic.",
            "And it was the most surreal kind  of deja vu experience I've ever had,  because I would know before I turned a corner  what was going to be there before the lights  of the vehicle actually revealed it,  because I had walked the set for months  when we were making the movie.",
            "And the set was based as an exact replica  on the blueprints of the ship.",
            "So, it was this absolutely remarkable experience.",
            "And it really made me realize that  the telepresense experience  that you actually can have these robotic avatars,  then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle,  into this other form of existence.",
            "It was really really quite profound.",
            "And may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening  some decades out  as we start to have cyborg bodies  for exploration or for other means  in many sort of  post-human futures  that I can imagine,  as a science fiction fan.",
            "So, having done these expeditions,  and really beginning to appreciate what was down there,  such as at the deep ocean vents  where we had these amazing amazing animals.",
            "They are basically aliens right here on Earth.",
            "They live in an environment of chemosynthesis.",
            "They don't survive on sunlight  based system the way we do.",
            "And so, you're seeing animals that are living next to  a 500 degree Centigrade  water plumes.",
            "You think they can't possibly exist.",
            "At the same time  I was getting very interested in space science as well,  again, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid.",
            "And I wound up getting involved with  the space community,  really involved with NASA,  sitting on the NASA advisory board,  planning actual space missions,  going to Russia, going to the pre-cosmonaut  biomedical protocols,  and all these sorts of things,  to actually go and fly to the international space station  with our 3D camera systems.",
            "And this was fascinating.",
            "But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists  with us into the deep.",
            "And taking them down so that they had access  astrobiologists, planetary scientists,  people who were interested in these extreme environments,  taking them down to the vents, and letting them see,  and take samples and test instruments, and so on.",
            "So, here we were making documentary films,  but actually doing science,  and actually doing space science.",
            "I'd completely closed the loop  between being the science fiction fan,  you know, as a kid,  and doing this stuff for real.",
            "And you know, along the way in this journey  of discovery,  I learned a lot.",
            "I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot  about leadership.",
            "Now you think director has got to be a leader,  leader of, captain of the ship, and all that sort of thing.",
            "I didn't really learn about leadership  until I did these expeditions.",
            "Because I had to, at a certain point, say,  \"What am I doing out here?",
            "Why am I doing this? What do I get out of it?\"",
            "We don't make money at these damn shows.",
            "We barely break even. There is no fame in it.",
            "People sort of think I went away  between \"Titanic\" and \"Avatar\" and was buffing my nails  someplace, sitting at the beach.",
            "Made all these films, made all these documentary films  for a very limited audience.",
            "No fame, no glory, no money. What are you doing?",
            "You're doing it for the task itself,  for the challenge --  and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is,  for the thrill of discovery,  and for that strange bond that happens  when a small group of people form a tightly knit team.",
            "Because we would do these things with 10-12 people  working for years at a time.",
            "Sometimes at sea for 2-3 months at a time.",
            "And in that bond, you realize  that the most important thing  is the respect that you have for them  and that they have for you, that you've done a task  that you can't explain to someone else.",
            "When you come back to the shore and you say,  \"We had to do this, and the fiber optic, and the attentuation,  and the this and that,  all the technology of it, and the difficulty,  the human performance aspects of working at sea,  you can't explain it to people. It's that thing that  maybe cops have, or people in combat that have gone through something together  and they know they can never explain it.",
            "Creates a bond, creates a bond of respect.",
            "So, when I came back to make my next movie,  which was \"Avatar,\"  I tried to apply that same principle of leadership  which is that you respect your team,  and you earn their respect in return.",
            "And it really changed the dynamic.",
            "So, here I was again with a small team,  in uncharted territory  doing \"Avatar,\" coming up with new technology  that didn't exist before.",
            "Tremendously exciting.",
            "Tremendously challenging.",
            "And we became a family, over a four and half year period.",
            "And it completely changed how I do movies.",
            "So, people have commented on how, well, you know,  you brought back the ocean organisms  and put them on the planet of Pandora.",
            "To me it was more of a fundamental way of doing business,  the process itself, that changed as a result of that.",
            "So, what can we synthesize out of all this?",
            "You know, what are the lessons learned?",
            "Well, I think number one is  curiosity.",
            "It's the most powerful thing you own.",
            "Imagination is a force  that can actually manifest a reality.",
            "And the respect of your team  is more important than all the  laurels in the world.",
            "I have young film makers  come up to me and say, \"Give me some advice for doing this.\"",
            "And I say, \"Don't put limitations on yourself.",
            "Other people will do that for you, don't do it to yourself,  don't bet against yourself.",
            "And take risks.\"",
            "NASA has this phrase that they like:  \"Failure is not an option.\"",
            "But failure has to be an option  in art and in exploration, because it's a leap of faith.",
            "And no important endeavor  that required innovation  was done without risk.",
            "You have to be willing to take those risks.",
            "So, that's the thought I would leave you with,  is that in whatever you're doing,  failure is an option,  but fear is not. Thank you.",

            "If I can leave you with one big idea today,  it's that the whole of the data  in which we consume  is greater that the sum of the parts,  and, instead of thinking about information overload,  what I'd like you to think about is how  we can use information so that patterns pop  and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible.",

            "And, right away, I see there's a different pattern that emerges.",
            "This is because, in the mid-area here,  people are at their most active,  and over here they're at their most frail.",
            "We can step back out again  and then reorganize the data by cause of death,  seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer  are the usual suspects, but not for everyone.",
            "If we go ahead and we filter by age,  say 40 years or less,  we see that accidents are actually  the greatest cause that people have to be worried about.",
            "And if you drill into that, it's especially the case for men.",
            "So you get the idea  that viewing information, viewing data in this way,  is a lot like swimming  in a living information info-graphic.",
            "And if we can do this for raw data,  why not do it for content as well?",

            "And as I played  I understood that there was a profound change  occurring in Nathaniel's eyes.",
            "It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical,  a chemical reaction, for which my playing the music  was its catalyst.",
            "And Nathaniel's manic rage  was transformed into understanding,  a quiet curiosity, and grace.",
            "And in a miracle, he lifted his own violin,  and he started playing, by ear,  certain snippets of violin concertos  which he then asked me to complete, Mendelssohn,  Tchaikovsky, Sibelius.",
            "And we started talking about music, from Bach  to Beethoven, and Brahms,  Bruckner, all the B's,  from Bartók, all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen.",
            "And I understood that he not only  had an encyclopedic knowledge of music,  but he related to this music at a personal level.",
            "He spoke about it with the kind of passion  and understanding that I share with my colleagues  in the Los Angeles Philharmonic.",
            "And through playing music and talking about music  this man had transformed  from the paranoid, disturbed man  that had just come from walking the streets  of downtown Los Angeles,  to the charming, erudite,  brilliant, Juilliard-trained musician.",
            "Music is medicine. Music changes us.",
            "And for Nathaniel, music is sanity.",
            "Because music allows him to take his thoughts  and delusions, and shape them  through his imagination and his creativity,  into reality.",
            "And that is an escape  from his tormented state.",
            "And I understood that this was the very essence of art.",
            "This was the very reason why we made music,  that we take something that exists within all of us,  at our very fundamental core,  our emotions,  and through our artistic lens,  through our creativity, we're able to shape those emotions into reality.",
            "And the reality of that expression  reaches all of us,  and moves us, inspires and unites us.",
            "And for Nathaniel,  music brought him back into a fold of friends.",
            "The redemptive power of music brought him back  into a family of musicians  that understood him,  that recognized his talents  and respected him.",
            "And I will always make music with Nathaniel,  whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall,  or on Skid Row, because he reminds me  why I became a musician.",

            "Tom Wujec presents some surprisingly deep research into the \"marshmallow problem\" -- a simple team-building exercise that involves dry spaghetti, one yard of tape and a marshmallow. Who can build the tallest tower with these ingredients? And why does a surprising group always beat the average?",
            "Several years ago, here at TED, Peter Skillman  introduced a design challenge  called the marshmallow challenge.",
            "And the idea's pretty simple.",
            "Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure  out of 20 sticks of spaghetti,  one yard of tape, one yard of string  and a marshmallow.",
            "The marshmallow has to be on top.",
            "And, though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hard,  because it forces people  to collaborate very quickly.",
            "And so I thought that this was an interesting idea,  and I incorporated it into a design workshop.",
            "And it was a huge success.",
            "And since then, I've conducted  about 70 design workshops across the world  with students and designers and architects,  even the CTOs of the Fortune 50,  and there's something about this exercise  that reveals very deep lessons  about the nature of collaboration,  and I'd like to share some of them with you.",
            "So, normally, most people begin  by orienting themselves to the task.",
            "They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like,  they jockey for power,  then they spend some time planning, organizing.",
            "They sketch and they lay out spaghetti  They spend the majority of their time  assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures  and then, finally, just as they're running out of time,  someone takes out the marshmallow,  and then they gingerly put it on top,  and then they stand back, and Ta-da!",
            "they admire their work.",
            "But what really happens, most of the time,  is that the \"ta-da\" turns into an \"uh-oh,\"  because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure  to buckle and to collapse.",
            "So there are a number of people  who have a lot more \"uh-oh\" moments than others,  and among the worst are recent graduates of business school.",
            "They lie, they cheat, they get distracted,  and they produce really lame structures.",
            "And of course there are teams  that have a lot more \"ta-da\" structures,  and, among the best, are recent graduates of kindergarten.",
            "And it's pretty amazing.",
            "As Peter tells us,  not only do they produce the tallest structures,  but they're the most interesting structures of them all.",
            "So the question you want to ask is:  How come? Why? What is it about them?",
            "And Peter likes to say that,  \"None of the kids spend any time  trying to be CEO of Spaghetti Inc.\" Right.",
            "They don't spend time jockeying for power.",
            "But there's another reason as well.",
            "And the reason is that business students are trained  to find the single right plan, right.",
            "And then they execute on it.",
            "And then what happens is, when they put the marshmallow on the top,  they run out of time, and what happens?",
            "It's a crisis.",
            "Sound familiar? Right.",
            "What kindergarteners do differently,  is that they start with the marshmallow,  and they build prototypes, successive prototypes,  always keeping the marshmallow on top,  so they have multiple times to fix ill built prototypes along the way.",
            "So designers recognize this type of collaboration  as the essence of the iterative process.",
            "And with each version, kids get instant feedback  about what works and what doesn't work.",
            "So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential,  but let's look at how different teams perform.",
            "So the average for most people is around 20 inches,  business schools students, about half of that,  lawyers, a little better, but not much better than that,  kindergarteners, better than most adults.",
            "Who does the very best?",
            "Architects and engineers, thankfully.",
            "39 inches is the tallest structure I've seen.",
            "And why is it? Because they understand triangles  and self-re-enforcing geometrical patterns  are the key to building  stable structures.",
            "So CEOs, a little bit better than average.",
            "But here's where it gets interesting.",
            "If you put you put an executive admin. on the team,  they get significantly better.",
            "It's incredible. You know, you look around, you go, \"Oh, that team's going to win.\"",
            "You can just tell beforehand. And why is that?",
            "Because they have special skills  of facilitation.",
            "They manage the process, they understand the process.",
            "And any team who manages  and pays a close attention to work  will significantly improve the team's performance.",
            "Specialized skills and facilitation skills  are the combination  leads to strong success.",
            "If you have 10 teams that typically perform,  you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures.",
            "And I tried something interesting.",
            "I thought, let's up the ante once.",
            "So I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team.",
            "So what do you think happened to these design students?",
            "What was the result?",
            "Here's what happened.",
            "Not one team had a standing structure.",
            "If anyone had built, say, a one inch structure,  they could have taken home the prize.",
            "So, isn't it interesting that high stakes  have a strong impact.",
            "We did the exercise again with the same students.",
            "What do you think happened then?",
            "So now they understand the value of prototyping.",
            "So the same team went from being the very worst  to being among the very best.",
            "They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time.",
            "So there's deep lessons for us  about the nature of incentives and success.",
            "So, you might ask: Why would anyone  actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge?",
            "And the reason is, I help create  digital tools and processes  to help teams build cars and video games  and visual effects.",
            "And what the marshmallow challenge does  is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions.",
            "Because, frankly,  every project has its own marshmallow, doesn't it.",
            "The challenge provides a shared experience,  a common language,  common stance to build the right prototype.",
            "And so, this is the value of the experience,  of this so simple exercise.",
            "And those of you who are interested,  may want to go to marshmallowchallenge.com.",
            "It's a blog that you can look at  how to build the marshmallows.",
            "There's step-by-step instructions on this.",
            "There are crazy examples from around the world  of how people tweak and adjust the system.",
            "There's world records on this as well.",
            "And the fundamental lesson, I believe,  is that design truly is  a contact sport.",
            "It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task,  and that we apply the very best of our thinking,  our feeling and our doing  to the challenge that we have at hand.",
            "And, sometimes, a little prototype of this experience  is all that it takes to turn us  from an \"uh-oh\" moment to a \"ta-da\" moment.",
            "And that can make a big difference.",
            "Thank you very much.",

            "I'm going to do an international biennial, I need artists from all around the world.",
            "So what I did was  I invented a hundred artists from around the world.",
            "I figured out their bios, their their passions in life  and their art styles,  and I started making their work.",
            "I felt, oh this is the kind of project that I could spend my whole life doing.",
            "So I decided, I'm going to make this a real biennial.",

            "So I should start to talk about these guys.",
            "Well the range is quite a bit.",
            "And I'm such a technician, so I loved project,  getting to play with all the techniques.",
            "So for example, in realist paintings,  it ranges from this,  which is kind of old masters style,  to really realistic still-life,  to this type of painting where I'm painting with a single hair.",
            "And then at the other end, there's performance and short films  and indoor installations  like this indoor installation  and this one,  and outdoor installations like this one  and this one.",

            "This piece, which is called \"Flipped Earth\" --  she was interested in taking the sky  and using it to cleanse barren ground.",
            "And by taking giant mirrors --  And here she's taking giant mirrors  and pulling them into the dirt.",
            "And this is 22 ft. long.",
            "And what I loved about her work  is, when I would walk around it  and look down into the sky,  looking down to watch the sky,  and it unfolded in a new way.",
            "And probably the best part of this piece  is at dusk and dawn  when the twilight wedge has fallen and the ground's dark,  but there's still the light above, bright above.",
            "And so you're standing there and everything else is dark,  but there's this portal that you want to jump in.",
            "This piece was great. This is in my parents' backyard in Arkansas.",
            "And I love to dig a hole.",
            "So this piece was great fun,  because it was two days of digging in soft dirt.",
            "The next artist is Kay Overstry,  and she's interested in ephemerality and transience.",
            "And in her most recent project,  it's called \"Weather I Made.\"",
            "And she's making weather  on her body's scale.",
            "And this piece is \"Frost.\"",
            "And what she did was she went out on a cold, dry night  and breathed back and forth on the lawn  to leave --  to leave her life's mark,  the mark of her life.",
            "And so this is five foot, five inches of frost  that she left behind.",
            "The sun rises, and it melts away.",
            "And that was played by my mom.",
            "So the next artist, this is a group of Japanese artists,  a collective of Japanese artists --  in Tokyo.",
            "And they were interested in developing a new, alternative art space.",
            "And they needed funding for it,  so they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects.",
            "One of these is scratch-off masterpieces.",
            "And so what they're doing --  each of these artists on a nine by seven-inch card,  which they sell for 10 bucks,  they drew original works of art.",
            "And you buy one, and maybe you get a real piece, and maybe not.",
            "Well this has sparked a craze in Japan,  because everyone's wanting a masterpiece.",
            "And the ones that are the most sought after  are the ones that are only barely scratched off.",
            "And all these works, in some way,  talk about luck or fate or chance.",
            "Those first two  are portraits of mega-jackpot winners years before and after their win.",
            "And in this one it's called \"Drawing the Short Stick.\"",
            "I love these piece because I have a little cousin at home  who introduced me -- which I think is such a great introduction --  to a friend one day as, \"This is my cousin Shea.",
            "He draws sticks real good.\"",
            "Which is one of the best compliments ever.",
            "This artist is Gus Weinmueller,  and he's doing a project, a large project, called \"Art for the Peoples.\"",
            "And within this project, he's doing a smaller project  called \"Artists in Residence.\"",
            "And what he does is --  he spends a week at a time with a family.",
            "And he shows up on their porch, their doorstep,  with a toothbrush and pajamas,  and he's ready to spend the week with them.",
            "And using only what's present,  he goes in and makes a little abode studio to work out of.",
            "And he spends that week talking to the family  about what do they think great art is.",
            "He has all these discussions with their family.",
            "And he digs through everything they have,  and he finds materials to make work.",
            "And he makes a work  that answers what they think great art is.",
            "For this family, he made this still-life painting.",
            "And whatever he makes  somehow references nesting and space  and personal property.",
            "This next project,  this is by Jaochim Parisvega,  and he's interested in --  He believes art is everywhere waiting --  that it just needs a little bit of a push to happen.",
            "And he provides this push by harnessing natural forces,  like in his series where he used rain to make paintings.",
            "This project is called \"Love Nests.\"",
            "What he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him.",
            "So he put the material in places where the birds were going to collect them,  and they crafted his nests for him.",
            "And this one's called \"Lovelock's Nest.\"",
            "This one's called \"Mixtape Love Song's Nest.\"",
            "And this one's called \"Lovemaking Nest.\"",
            "Next is Sylvia Slater.",
            "Sylvia's interested in art training.",
            "She's a very serious Swiss artist.",
            "And she was thinking about her friends and family  who work in chaos-ridden places and developing countries,  and she was thinking,  what can I make that would be of value to them,  in case something bad happens  and they have to buy their way across the border  or pay off a gunman.",
            "And so she came up with creating  these pocket-sized artworks  that are portraits of the person that would carry them.",
            "And you would carry this around with you,  and if everything went to hell, you could make payments  and buy your life.",
            "So this life price  is for an irrigation non-profit director.",
            "So hopefully what happens is you never use it,  and it's an heirloom that you pass down.",
            "And she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments,  or they could be like these, which are leaves that can be payments.",
            "And so they're valuable. This is precious metals and gemstones.",
            "And this one had to get broken up.",
            "He had to break off a piece to get out of Egypt recently.",
            "This is by a duo, Michael Abernathy and Bud Holland.",
            "And they're interested in creating culture,  just tradition.",
            "So what they do is they move into an area  and try to establish a new tradition in a small geographic area.",
            "So this is in Eastern Tennessee,  and what they decided was  that we need a positive tradition  that goes with death.",
            "So they came up with dig jigs.",
            "And a dig jig --  a dig jig is where,  for a milestone anniversary or a birthday,  you gather all your friends and family together  and you dance on where you're going to be buried.",
            "And we got a lot of attention when we did it.",
            "I talked my family into doing this, and they didn't know what I was doing.",
            "And I was like, \"Get dressed for a funeral. We're going to go do some work.\"",
            "And so we got to the grave and made this, which was hilarious --  the attention that we got.",
            "So what happens is you dance on the grave.",
            "And after you've done your dance,  everyone toasts you and tells you how great you are.",
            "And you in essence have a funeral  that you get to be present for.",
            "That's my mom and dad.",
            "This is by Jason Birdsong.",
            "He is interested in how we see as an animal,  how we are interested in mimicry and camouflage.",
            "You know, we look down a dark alley  or a jungle path,  trying to make out a face or a creature.",
            "We just have that natural way of seeing.",
            "And he plays with this idea.",
            "And this piece: those aren't actually leaves.",
            "They're butterfly specimens who have a natural camouflage.",
            "So he pairs these up.",
            "There's another pile of leaves.",
            "Those are actually all real butterfly specimens.",
            "And he pairs these up with paintings.",
            "Like this is a painting of a snake in a box.",
            "So you open the box and you think, \"Who, there's a snake in there.\"",
            "But it's actually a painting.",
            "So he makes these interesting conversations  about realism and mimicry  and our drive to be fooled by great camouflage.",

            "Hazel Clausen is an anthropologist who took a sabbatical  and decided, \"You know, I would learn a lot about culture  if I created a culture that doesn't exist from scratch.\"",

            "It was so funny having a fake person  who was making fake things.",
            "And I crack up at this piece,  because when I see it I know that's French angora  and all antique German ribbons  and wool that I got in a Nebraska mill  and carried around for 10 years  and then antique Chinese skirts.",
            "The next is a collective of artists  called the Silver Dobermans.",
            "And their motto is to spread pragmatism  one person at a time.",
            "And they're really interested  in how over-coddled we've become.",
            "So this is one of their comments on how over-coddled we've become.",
            "And what they've done  is they put a warning sign on every single barb on this fence.",

            "Now it may seem kind of strange that such a thing can actually be patented, but it does happen all the time.",
            "Take something already being done and patent it for an emerging technology -- like phone calls on the internet or video listings for TV shows or radio but for cellphones, and so on.",
            "The problem with these patents is that the mechanisms are obscure and the patent system is dysfunctional, and as a result, most of these lawsuits end in settlements.",
            "And because these settlements are under a non-disclosure agreement, no one knows what the terms were.",
            "And as a result, the patent troll can claim that they won the case.",
            "In the case of Gooseberry Natural Resources, this patent on emailing news releases had sort of a fatal flaw as it pertained to myself, and that was that in the mainstream media world there is only one definition for news release, and it turns out that is press release -- as in P.R.",
            "Now my company, Fark, deals with news, ostensibly, and as a result we were not in violation of this patent.",
            "So case closed, right?",
            "Wrong.",
            "One of the major problems with patent law is that, in the case that when you are sued by a patent troll, the burden of proof that you did not infringe on the patent is actually on the defendant, which means you have to prove that you do not infringe on the patent they're suing you on.",
            "And this can take quite a while.",
            "You need to know that the average patent troll defense costs two million dollars and takes 18 months when you win.",
            "That is your best case outcome when you get sued by a patent troll.",
            "Now I had hoped to team up with some of these larger companies in order to defend against this lawsuit, but one-by-one they settled out of the case, even though -- and this is important -- none of these companies infringed on this patent -- not a one of them.",
            "And they started settling out.",
            "The reason they settled out is because it's cheaper to settle than to fight the lawsuit -- clearly, two million dollars cheaper in some cases, and much worse if you actually lose.",

            "And in discovery phase, we asked the patent troll to please provide screenshots of Fark where the infringement of their patent was actually occurring.",

            "Their attorney: \"Ah, yes. My company's having a reorganization on our end.\"",

            "No counter offer.",
            "Now, as mentioned before, one of the reasons I can talk to you about this is because there's no non-disclosure agreement on this case.",

            "Patents are very difficult to overturn.",
            "Infringement is a lot easier to disprove.",
            "Secondly, make it clear from the beginning that either you have no money at all or that you would rather spend money with your attorney fighting the troll than actually giving them the money.",
            "Now the reason this works is because patent trolls are paid a percentage of what they're able to recover in settlements.",
            "If it becomes clear to them that they cannot recover any money, they become less interested in pursuing the case.",
            "Finally, make sure that you can tell them that you will make this process as annoying and as painful and as difficult as possible for them.",
            "Now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people to get their way.",
            "It turns out, because they're paid on contingency, it works really, really well in reverse.",
            "Don't forget that.",
            "So what does all this mean?",
            "Well to sum up, it boils down to one thing: Don't negotiate with terrorists.",
            "Patent trolls have done more damage to the United States economy than any domestic or foreign terrorist organization in history every year.",
            "And what do they do with that money?",
            "They plow it right back into filing more troll lawsuits.",
            "Now this is the point in the Talk where I'm supposed to come up with some kind of a solution for the patent system.",
            "And the problem with that is that there are two very large industry groups that have different outcomes in mind for the patent system.",
            "The health care industry would like stronger protections for inventors.",

            "And these goals aren't necessarily diametrically opposed, but they are at odds.",
            "And as a result, patent trolls can kind of live in the space in between.",

            "I painted a whole picture of the animal kingdom, and humanity included, was that deep down we are competitors, we are aggressive, we're all out for our own profit basically.",
            "This is the launch of my book.",
            "I'm not sure how well the chimpanzees read it, but they surely seemed interested in the book.",
            "Now in the process of doing all this work on power and dominance and aggression and so on, I discovered that chimpanzees reconcile after fights.",
            "And so what you see here is two males who have had a fight.",
            "They ended up in a tree, and one of them holds out a hand to the other.",
            "And about a second after I took the picture, they came together in the fork of the tree and they kissed and embraced each other.",
            "Now this is very interesting because at the time everything was about competition and aggression, and so it wouldn't make any sense.",
            "The only thing that matters is that you win or that you lose.",
            "But why would you reconcile after a fight?",
            "That doesn't make any sense.",
            "This is the way bonobos do it. Bonobos do everything with sex.",
            "And so they also reconcile with sex.",
            "But the principle is exactly the same.",
            "The principle is that you have a valuable relationship that is damaged by conflict, so you need to do something about it.",
            "So my whole picture of the animal kingdom, and including humans also, started to change at that time.",
            "So we have this image in political science, economics, the humanities, philosophy for that matter, that man is a wolf to man.",
            "And so deep down our nature's actually nasty.",
            "I think it's a very unfair image for the wolf.",
            "The wolf is, after all, a very cooperative animal.",
            "And that's why many of you have a dog at home, which has all these characteristics also.",
            "And it's really unfair to humanity, because humanity is actually much more cooperative and empathic than given credit for.",
            "So I started getting interested in those issues and studying that in other animals.",
            "So these are the pillars of morality.",
            "If you ask anyone, \"What is morality based on?\" these are the two factors that always come out.",
            "One is reciprocity, and associated with it is a sense of justice and a sense of fairness.",
            "And the other one is empathy and compassion.",
            "And human morality is more than this, but if you would remove these two pillars, there would be not much remaining I think.",
            "And so they're absolutely essential.",
            "So let me give you a few examples here.",
            "This is a very old video from the Yerkes Primate Center where they train chimpanzees to cooperate.",
            "So this is already about a hundred years ago that we were doing experiments on cooperation.",
            "What you have here is two young chimpanzees who have a box, and the box is too heavy for one chimp to pull in.",
            "And of course, there's food on the box.",
            "Otherwise they wouldn't be pulling so hard.",
            "And so they're bringing in the box.",
            "And you can see that they're synchronized.",
            "You can see that they work together, they pull at the same moment.",
            "It's already a big advance over many other animals who wouldn't be able to do that.",
            "And now you're going to get a more interesting picture, because now one of the two chimps has been fed.",
            "So one of the two is not really interested in the task anymore.",
            "Now look at what happens at the very end of this.",
            "He takes basically everything.",
            "So there are two interesting parts about this.",
            "One is that the chimp on the right has a full understanding he needs the partner -- so a full understanding of the need for cooperation.",
            "The second one is that the partner is willing to work even though he's not interested in the food.",
            "Why would that be? Well that probably has to do with reciprocity.",
            "There's actually a lot of evidence in primates and other animals that they return favors.",
            "So he will get a return favor at some point in the future.",
            "And so that's how this all operates.",
            "We do the same task with elephants.",
            "Now with elephants, it's very dangerous to work with elephants.",
            "Another problem with elephants is that you cannot make an apparatus that is too heavy for a single elephant.",
            "Now you can probably make it, but it's going to be a pretty flimsy apparatus I think.",
            "And so what we did in that case -- we do these studies in Thailand for Josh Plotnik -- is we have an apparatus around which there is a rope, a single rope.",
            "And if you pull on this side of the rope, the rope disappears on the other side.",
            "So two elephants need to pick it up at exactly the same time and pull.",
            "Otherwise nothing is going to happen and the rope disappears.",
            "And the first tape you're going to see is two elephants who are released together arrive at the apparatus.",
            "The apparatus is on the left with food on it.",
            "And so they come together, they arrive together, they pick it up together and they pull together.",
            "So it's actually fairly simple for them.",
            "There they are.",
            "And so that's how they bring it in.",
            "But now we're going to make it more difficult.",
            "Because the whole purpose of this experiment is to see how well they understand cooperation.",
            "Do they understand that as well as the chimps, for example?",
            "And so what we do in the next step is we release one elephant before the other, and that elephant needs to be smart enough to stay there and wait and not pull at the rope -- because if he pulls at the rope, it disappears and the whole test is over.",
            "Now this elephant does something illegal that we did not teach it.",
            "But it shows the understanding that he has, because he puts his big foot on the rope, stands on the rope and waits there for the other, and then the other is going to do all the work for him.",
            "So it's what we call freeloading.",
            "But it shows the intelligence that the elephants have.",
            "They develop several of these alternative techniques that we did not approve of necessarily.",
            "So the other elephant is now coming and is going to pull it in.",
            "Now look at the other. The other doesn't forget to eat, of course.",
            "This was the cooperation, reciprocity part.",
            "Now something on empathy.",
            "Empathy is my main topic at the moment of research.",
            "And empathy has sort of two qualities.",
            "One is the understanding part of it. This is just a regular definition: the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.",
            "And the emotional part.",
            "And so empathy has basically two channels.",
            "One is the body channel.",
            "If you talk with a sad person, you're going to adopt a sad expression and a sad posture, and before you know it you feel sad.",
            "And that's sort of the body channel of emotional empathy, which many animals have.",
            "Your average dog has that also.",
            "That's actually why people keep mammals in the home and not turtles or snakes or something like that who don't have that kind of empathy.",
            "And then there's a cognitive channel, which is more that you can take the perspective of somebody else.",
            "And that's more limited.",
            "There's few animals -- I think elephants and apes can do that kind of thing -- but there are very few animals who can do that.",
            "So synchronization, which is part of that whole empathy mechanism is a very old one in the animal kingdom.",
            "And in humans, of course, we can study that with yawn contagion.",
            "Humans yawn when others yawn.",
            "And it's related to empathy.",
            "It activates the same areas in the brain.",
            "Also, we know that people who have a lot of yawn contagion are highly empathic.",
            "People who have problems with empathy, such as autistic children, they don't have yawn contagion.",
            "So it is connected.",
            "And we study that in our chimpanzees by presenting them with an animated head.",
            "So that's what you see on the upper-left, an animated head that yawns.",
            "And there's a chimpanzee watching, an actual real chimpanzee watching a computer screen on which we play these animations.",
            "So yawn contagion that you're probably all familiar with -- and maybe you're going to start yawning soon now -- is something that we share with other animals.",
            "And that's related to that whole body channel of synchronization that underlies empathy and that is universal in the mammals basically.",
            "Now we also study more complex expressions. This is consolation.",
            "This is a male chimpanzee who has lost a fight and he's screaming, and a juvenile comes over and puts an arm around him and calms him down.",
            "That's consolation. It's very similar to human consolation.",
            "And consolation behavior, it's empathy driven.",
            "Actually the way to study empathy in human children is to instruct a family member to act distressed, and then they see what young children do.",
            "And so it is related to empathy, and that's the kind of expressions we look at.",
            "We also recently published an experiment you may have heard about.",
            "It's on altruism and chimpanzees where the question is, do chimpanzees care about the welfare of somebody else?",
            "And for decades it had been assumed that only humans can do that, that only humans worry about the welfare of somebody else.",
            "Now we did a very simple experiment.",
            "We do that on chimpanzees that live in Lawrenceville, in the field station of Yerkes.",
            "And so that's how they live.",
            "And we call them into a room and do experiments with them.",
            "In this case, we put two chimpanzees side-by-side.",
            "and one has a bucket full of tokens, and the tokens have different meanings.",
            "One kind of token feeds only the partner who chooses, the other one feeds both of them.",
            "So this is a study we did with Vicky Horner.",
            "And here you have the two color tokens.",
            "So they have a whole bucket full of them.",
            "And they have to pick one of the two colors.",
            "You will see how that goes.",
            "So if this chimp makes the selfish choice, which is the red token in this case, he needs to give it to us.",
            "So we pick it up, we put it on a table where there's two food rewards, but in this case only the one on the right gets food.",
            "The one on the left walks away because she knows already. that this is not a good test for her.",
            "Then the next one is the pro-social token.",
            "So the one who makes the choices -- that's the interesting part here -- for the one who makes the choices, it doesn't really matter.",
            "So she gives us now a pro-social token and both chimps get fed.",
            "So the one who makes the choices always gets a reward.",
            "So it doesn't matter whatsoever.",
            "And she should actually be choosing blindly.",
            "But what we find is that they prefer the pro-social token.",
            "So this is the 50 percent line that's the random expectation.",
            "And especially if the partner draws attention to itself, they choose more.",
            "And if the partner puts pressure on them -- so if the partner starts spitting water and intimidating them -- then the choices go down.",
            "It's as if they're saying, \"If you're not behaving, I'm not going to be pro-social today.\" And this is what happens without a partner, when there's no partner sitting there.",
            "And so we found that the chimpanzees do care about the well-being of somebody else -- especially, these are other members of their own group.",
            "So the final experiment that I want to mention to you is our fairness study.",
            "And so this became a very famous study.",
            "And there's now many more, because after we did this about 10 years ago, it became very well known.",
            "And we did that originally with capuchin monkeys.",
            "And I'm going to show you the first experiment that we did.",
            "It has now been done with dogs and with birds and with chimpanzees.",
            "But with Sarah Brosnan we started out with capuchin monkeys.",
            "So what we did is we put two capuchin monkeys side-by-side.",
            "Again, these animals, they live in a group, they know each other.",
            "We take them out of the group, put them in a test chamber.",
            "And there's a very simple task that they need to do.",
            "And if you give both of them cucumber for the task, the two monkeys side-by-side, they're perfectly willing to do this 25 times in a row.",
            "So cucumber, even though it's only really water in my opinion, but cucumber is perfectly fine for them.",
            "Now if you give the partner grapes -- the food preferences of my capuchin monkeys correspond exactly with the prices in the supermarket -- and so if you give them grapes -- it's a far better food -- then you create inequity between them.",
            "So that's the experiment we did.",
            "Recently we videotaped it with new monkeys who'd never done the task, thinking that maybe they would have a stronger reaction, and that turned out to be right.",
            "The one on the left is the monkey who gets cucumber.",
            "The one on the right is the one who gets grapes.",
            "The one who gets cucumber, note that the first piece of cucumber is perfectly fine.",
            "The first piece she eats.",
            "Then she sees the other one getting grape, and you will see what happens.",
            "So she gives a rock to us. That's the task.",
            "And we give her a piece of cucumber and she eats it.",
            "The other one needs to give a rock to us.",
            "And that's what she does.",
            "And she gets a grape and she eats it.",
            "The other one sees that.",
            "She gives a rock to us now, gets, again, cucumber.",
            "She tests a rock now against the wall.",
            "She needs to give it to us.",
            "And she gets cucumber again.",
            "So this is basically the Wall Street protest that you see here.",
            "Let me tell you -- I still have two minutes left, let me tell you a funny story about this.",
            "This study became very famous and we got a lot of comments, especially anthropologists, economists, philosophers.",
            "They didn't like this at all.",
            "Because they had decided in their minds, I believe, that fairness is a very complex issue and that animals cannot have it.",
            "And so one philosopher even wrote us that it was impossible that monkeys had a sense of fairness because fairness was invented during the French Revolution.",
            "Now another one wrote a whole chapter saying that he would believe it had something to do with fairness if the one who got grapes would refuse the grapes.",
            "Now the funny thing is that Sarah Brosnan, who's been doing this with chimpanzees, had a couple of combinations of chimpanzees where, indeed, the one who would get the grape would refuse the grape until the other guy also got a grape.",
            "So we're getting very close to the human sense of fairness.",
            "And I think philosophers need to rethink their philosophy for awhile.",
            "So let me summarize.",
            "I believe there's an evolved morality.",
            "I think morality is much more than what I've been talking about, but it would be impossible without these ingredients that we find in other primates, which are empathy and consolation, pro-social tendencies and reciprocity and a sense of fairness.",
            "And so we work on these particular issues to see if we can create a morality from the bottom up, so to speak, without necessarily God and religion involved, and to see how we can get to an evolved morality.",
            "And I thank you for your attention.",

            "I was already up at 4.4.",
            "And as you can see, my aorta dilated progressively, and I got closer and closer to the point where surgery was going to be necessary.",
            "The surgery on offer was pretty gruesome -- anesthetize you, open your chest, put you on an artificial heart and lung machine, drop your body temperature to about 18 centigrade, stop your heart, cut the aorta out, replace it with a plastic valve and a plastic aorta, and, most importantly, commit you to a lifetime of anticoagulation therapy, normally warfarin.",
            "The thought of the surgery was not attractive.",
            "The thought of the warfarin was really quite frightening.",
            "So I said to myself, I'm an engineer, I'm in R and D, this is just a plumbing problem.",
            "I can do this. I can change this.",

            "The project aim is really quite simple.",

            "It really is that simple in concept, though not in execution.",

            "If you had an acute congestive heart failure, they could bleed a pint of blood from you by opening up an arm vein, giving you a crude leaf preparation of digitalis and then giving you oxygen by tent.",
            "If you had early signs of paralysis and you were really good at asking personal questions, you might figure out that this paralysis someone has is from syphilis, in which case you could give this nice concoction of mercury and arsenic -- as long as you didn't overdose them and kill them.",
            "Beyond these sorts of things, a medical doctor didn't have a lot that they could do.",
            "This was when the core structure of medicine was created -- what it meant to be good at what we did and how we wanted to build medicine to be.",
            "It was at a time when what was known you could know, you could hold it all in your head, and you could do it all.",
            "If you had a prescription pad, if you had a nurse, if you had a hospital that would give you a place to convalesce, maybe some basic tools, you really could do it all.",

            "There's another sign that we need pit crews, and that's the unmanageable cost of our care.",

            "And we had a mix of dumb stuff on there -- making sure an antibiotic is given in the right time frame because that cuts the infection rate by half -- and then interesting stuff, because you can't make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery.",
            "Instead, you can make a recipe for how to have a team that's prepared for the unexpected.",
            "And we had items like making sure everyone in the room had introduced themselves by name at the start of the day, because you get half a dozen people or more who are sometimes coming together as a team for the very first time that day that you're coming in.",

            "And it's been slow to spread.",
            "This is not yet our norm in surgery -- let alone making checklists to go onto childbirth and other areas.",
            "There's a deep resistance because using these tools forces us to confront that we're not a system, forces us to behave with a different set of values.",
            "Just using a checklist requires you to embrace different values from the ones we've had, like humility, discipline, teamwork.",

            "At TEDxCambridge, Michael Norton shares fascinating research on how money can, indeed buy happiness -- when you don't spend it on yourself. Listen for surprising data on the many ways pro-social spending can benefit you, your work, and  other people.",
            "So I want to talk today about money and happiness, which are two things that a lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking about, either trying to earn them or trying to increase them.",
            "And a lot of us resonate with this phrase.",
            "So we see it in religions and self-help books, that money can't buy happiness.",
            "And I want to suggest today that, in fact, that's wrong.",
            "I'm at a business school, so that's what we do.",
            "So that's wrong, and, in fact, if you think that, you're actually just not spending it right.",
            "So that instead of spending it the way you usually spend it, maybe if you spent it differently, that might work a little bit better.",
            "And before I tell you the ways that you can spend it that will make you happier, let's think about the ways we usually spend it that don't, in fact, make us happier.",
            "We had a little natural experiment.",
            "So CNN, a little while ago, wrote this interesting article on what happens to people when they win the lottery.",
            "It turns out people think when they win the lottery their lives are going to be amazing.",
            "This article's about how their lives get ruined.",
            "So what happens when people win the lottery is, number one, they spend all the money and go into debt, and number two, all of their friends and everyone they've ever met find them and bug them for money.",
            "And it ruins their social relationships, in fact.",
            "So they have more debt and worse friendships than they had before they won the lottery.",
            "What was interesting about the article was people started commenting on the article, readers of the thing.",
            "And instead of talking about how it had made them realize that money doesn't lead to happiness, everyone instantly started saying, \"You know what I would do if I won the lottery ... ?\" and fantasizing about what they'd do.",
            "And here's just two of the ones we saw that are just really interesting to think about.",
            "One person wrote in, \"When I win, I'm going to buy my own little mountain and have a little house on top.\"  And another person wrote, \"I would fill a big bathtub with money and get in the tub while smoking a big fat cigar and sipping a glass of champagne.\" This is even worse now: \"Then I'd have a picture taken and dozens of glossies made.",
            "Anyone begging for money or trying to extort from me would receive a copy of the picture and nothing else.\"  And so many of the comments were exactly of this type, where people got money and, in fact, it made them antisocial.",
            "So I told you that it ruins people's lives and that their friends bug them.",
            "It also, money often makes us feel very selfish and we do things only for ourselves.",
            "Well maybe the reason that money doesn't make us happy is that we're always spending it on the wrong things, and in particular, that we're always spending it on ourselves.",
            "And we thought, I wonder what would happen if we made people spend more of their money on other people.",
            "So instead of being antisocial with your money, what if you were a little more prosocial with your money?",
            "And we thought, let's make people do it and see what happens.",
            "So let's have some people do what they usually do and spend money on themselves, and let's make some people give money away, and measure their happiness and see if, in fact, they get happier.",
            "So the first way that we did this.",
            "On one Vancouver morning, we went out on the campus at University of British Columbia and we approached people and said, \"Do you want to be in an experiment?\" They said, \"Yes.\" We asked them how happy they were, and then we gave them an envelope.",
            "And one of the envelopes had things in it that said, \"By 5:00 pm today, spend this money on yourself.\" So we gave some examples of what you could spend it on.",
            "Other people, in the morning, got a slip of paper that said, \"By 5:00 pm today, spend this money on somebody else.\" Also inside the envelope was money.",
            "And we manipulated how much money we gave them.",
            "So some people got this slip of paper and five dollars.",
            "Some people got this slip of paper and 20 dollars.",
            "We let them go about their day. They did whatever they wanted to do.",
            "We found out that they did in fact spend it in the way that we asked them to.",
            "We called them up at night and asked them, \"What'd you spend it on, and how happy do you feel now?\" What did they spend it on?",
            "Well these are college undergrads, so a lot of what they spent it on for themselves were things like earrings and makeup.",
            "One woman said she bought a stuffed animal for her niece.",
            "People gave money to homeless people.",
            "Huge effect here of Starbucks.",
            "So if you give undergraduates five dollars, it looks like coffee to them and they run over to Starbucks and spend it as fast as they can.",
            "But some people bought a coffee for themselves, the way they usually would, but other people said that they bought a coffee for somebody else.",
            "So the very same purchase, just targeted toward yourself or targeted toward somebody else.",
            "What did we find when we called them back at the end of the day?",
            "People who spent money on other people got happier.",
            "People who spent money on themselves, nothing happened.",
            "It didn't make them less happy, it just didn't do much for them.",
            "And the other thing we saw is the amount of money doesn't matter that much.",
            "So people thought that 20 dollars would be way better than five dollars.",
            "In fact, it doesn't matter how much money you spent.",
            "What really matters is that you spent it on somebody else rather than on yourself.",
            "We see this again and again when we give people money to spend on other people instead of on themselves.",
            "Of course, these are undergraduates in Canada -- not the world's most representative population.",
            "They're also fairly wealthy and affluent and all these other sorts of things.",
            "We wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world or just among wealthy countries.",
            "So we went, in fact, to Uganda and ran a very similar experiment.",
            "So imagine, instead of just people in Canada, we said, \"Name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people.",
            "Describe it. How happy did it make you?\" Or in Uganda, \"Name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people and describe that.\" And then we asked them how happy they are again.",
            "And what we see is sort of amazing because there's human universals on what you do with your money and then real cultural differences on what you do as well.",
            "So for example, one guy from Uganda says this.",
            "He said, \"I called a girl I wished to love.\" They basically went out on a date, and he says at the end that he didn't \"achieve\" her up till now.",
            "Here's a guy from Canada.",
            "Very similar thing.",
            "\"I took my girlfriend out for dinner.",
            "We went to a movie, we left early, and then went back to her room for ... \" only cake -- just a piece of cake.",
            "Human universal -- so you spend money on other people, you're being nice to them.",
            "Maybe you have something in mind, maybe not.",
            "But then we see extraordinary differences.",
            "So look at these two.",
            "This is a woman from Canada.",
            "We say, \"Name a time you spent money on somebody else.\" She says, \"I bought a present for my mom.",
            "I drove to the mall in my car, bought a present, gave it to my mom.\" Perfectly nice thing to do.",
            "It's good to get gifts for people that you know.",
            "Compare that to this woman from Uganda.",
            "\"I was walking and met a long-time friend whose son was sick with malaria.",
            "They had no money, they went to a clinic and I gave her this money.\" This isn't $10,000, it's the local currency.",
            "So it's a very small amount of money, in fact.",
            "But enormously different motivations here.",
            "This is a real medical need, literally a life-saving donation.",
            "Above, it's just kind of, I bought a gift for my mother.",
            "What we see again though is that the specific way that you spend on other people isn't nearly as important as the fact that you spend on other people in order to make yourself happy, which is really quite important.",
            "So you don't have to do amazing things with your money to make yourself happy.",
            "You can do small, trivial things and yet still get these benefits from doing this.",
            "These are only two countries.",
            "We also wanted to go even broader and look at every country in the world if we could to see what the relationship is between money and happiness.",
            "We got data from the Gallup Organization, which you know from all the political polls that have been happening lately.",
            "They ask people, \"Did you donate money to charity recently?\" and they ask them, \"How happy are you with your life in general?\" And we can see what the relationship is between those two things.",
            "Are they positively correlated? Giving money makes you happy.",
            "Or are they negatively correlated?",
            "On this map, green will mean they're positively correlated and red means they're negatively correlated.",
            "And you can see, the world is crazily green.",
            "So in almost every country in the world where we have this data, people who give money to charity are happier people that people who don't give money to charity.",
            "I know you're all looking at that red country in the middle.",
            "I would be a jerk and not tell you what it is, but in fact, it's Central African Republic.",
            "You can make up stories. Maybe it's different there for some reason or another.",
            "Just below that to the right is Rwanda though, which is amazingly green.",
            "So almost everywhere we look we see that giving money away makes you happier than keeping it for yourself.",
            "What about your work life, which is where we spend all the rest of our time when we're not with the people we know.",
            "We decided to infiltrate some companies and do a very similar thing.",
            "So these are sales teams in Belgium.",
            "They work in teams; they go out and sell to doctors and try to get them to buy drugs.",
            "So we can look and see how well they sell things as a function of being a member of a team.",
            "Some teams, we give people on the team some money for themselves and say, \"Spend it however you want on yourself,\" just like we did with the undergrads in Canada.",
            "But other teams we say, \"Here's 15 euro.",
            "Spend it on one of your teammates this week.",
            "Buy them something as a gift or a present and give it to them.",
            "And then we can see, well now we've got teams that spend on themselves and we've got these prosocial teams who we give money to make the team a little bit better.",
            "The reason I have a ridiculous pinata there is one of the teams pooled their money and bought a pinata, and they all got around and smashed the pinata and all the candy fell out and things like that.",
            "A very silly, trivial thing to do, but think of the difference on a team that didn't do that at all, that got 15 euro, put it in their pocket, maybe bought themselves a coffee, or teams that had this prosocial experience where they all bonded together to buy something and do a group activity.",
            "What we see is that, in fact, the teams that are prosocial sell more stuff than the teams that only got money for themselves.",
            "And one way to think about it is for every 15 euro you give people for themselves, they put it in their pocket, they don't do anything different than they did before.",
            "You don't get any money from that.",
            "You actually lose money because it doesn't motivate them to perform any better.",
            "But when you give them 15 euro to spend on their teammates, they do so much better on their teams that you actually get a huge win on investing this kind of money.",
            "And I realize that you're probably thinking to yourselves, this is all fine, but there's a context that's incredibly important for public policy and I can't imagine it would work there.",
            "And basically that if he doesn't show me that it works here, I don't believe anything he said.",
            "And I know what you're all thinking about are dodgeball teams.",
            "This was a huge criticism that we got to say, if you can't show it with dodgeball teams, this is all stupid.",
            "So we went out and found these dodgeball teams and infiltrated them.",
            "And we did the exact same thing as before.",
            "So some teams, we give people on the team money, they spend it on themselves.",
            "Other teams, we give them money to spend on their dodgeball teammates.",
            "The teams that spend money on themselves are just the same winning percentages as they were before.",
            "The teams that we give the money to spend on each other, they become different teams and, in fact, they dominate the league by the time they're done.",
            "Across all of these different contexts -- your personal life, you work life, even silly things like intramural sports -- we see spending on other people has a bigger return for you than spending on yourself.",
            "And so I'll just say, I think if you think money can't buy happiness you're not spending it right.",
            "The implication is not you should buy this product instead of that product and that's the way to make yourself happier.",
            "It's in fact, that you should stop thinking about which product to buy for yourself and try giving some of it to other people instead.",
            "And we luckily have an opportunity for you.",
            "DonorsChoose.org is a non-profit for mainly public school teachers in low-income schools.",
            "They post projects, so they say, \"I want to teach Huckleberry Finn to my class and we don't have the books,\" or \"I want a microscope to teach my students science and we don't have a microscope.\"",
            "You and I can go on and buy it for them.",
            "The teacher writes you a thank you note. The kids write you a thank you note.",
            "Sometimes they send you pictures of them using the microscope.",
            "It's an extraordinary thing.",
            "Go to the website and start yourself on the process of thinking, again, less about \"How can I spend money on myself?\" and more about \"If I've got five dollars or 15 dollars, what can I do to benefit other people?\" Because ultimately when you do that, you'll find that you'll benefit yourself much more.",
            "Thank you.",

            "Imagine what we could learn about diseases by studying the history of human disease, from ancient hominids to the present. But how? TED Fellow Christina Warinner is an achaeological geneticist, and she's found a spectacular new tool -- the microbial DNA in fossilized dental plaque.",
            "Have you ever wondered what is inside your dental plaque?",
            "Probably not, but people like me do.",
            "I'm an archeological geneticist at the Center for Evolutionary Medicine at the University of Zurich, and I study the origins and evolution of human health and disease by conducting genetic research on the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient humans.",
            "And through this work, I hope to better understand the evolutionary vulnerabilities of our bodies, so that we can improve and better manage our health in the future.",
            "There are different ways to approach evolutionary medicine, and one way is to extract human DNA from ancient bones.",
            "And from these extracts, we can reconstruct the human genome at different points in time and look for changes that might be related to adaptations, risk factors and inherited diseases.",
            "But this is only one half of the story.",
            "The most important health challenges today are not caused by simple mutations in our genome, but rather result from a complex and dynamic interplay between genetic variation, diet, microbes and parasites and our immune response.",
            "All of these diseases have a strong evolutionary component that directly relates to the fact that we live today in a very different environment than the ones in which our bodies evolved.",
            "And in order to understand these diseases, we need to move past studies of the human genome alone and towards a more holistic approach to human health in the past.",
            "But there are a lot of challenges for this.",
            "And first of all, what do we even study?",
            "Skeletons are ubiquitous; they're found all over the place.",
            "But of course, all of the soft tissue has decomposed, and the skeleton itself has limited health information.",
            "Mummies are a great source of information, except that they're really geographically limited and limited in time as well.",
            "Coprolites are fossilized human feces, and they're actually extremely interesting.",
            "You can learn a lot about ancient diet and intestinal disease, but they are very rare.",
            "So to address this problem, I put together a team of international researchers in Switzerland, Denmark and the U.K.",
            "to study a very poorly studied, little known material that's found on people everywhere.",
            "It's a type of fossilized dental plaque that is called officially dental calculus.",
            "Many of you may know it by the term tartar.",
            "It's what the dentist cleans off your teeth every time that you go in for a visit.",
            "And in a typical dentistry visit, you may have about 15 to 30 milligrams removed.",
            "But in ancient times before tooth brushing, up to 600 milligrams might have built up on the teeth over a lifetime.",
            "And what's really important about dental calculus is that it fossilizes just like the rest of the skeleton, it's abundant in quantity before the present day and it's ubiquitous worldwide.",
            "We find it in every population around the world at all time periods going back tens of thousands of years.",
            "And we even find it in neanderthals and animals.",
            "And so previous studies had only focused on microscopy.",
            "They'd looked at dental calculus under a microscope, and what they had found was things like pollen and plant starches, and they'd found muscle cells from animal meats and bacteria.",
            "And so what my team of researchers, what we wanted to do, is say, can we apply genetic and proteomic technology to go after DNA and proteins, and from this can we get better taxonomic resolution to really understand what's going on?",
            "And what we found is that we can find many commensal and pathogenic bacteria that inhabited the nasal passages and mouth.",
            "We also have found immune proteins related to infection and inflammation and proteins and DNA related to diet.",
            "But what was surprising to us, and also quite exciting, is we also found bacteria that normally inhabit upper respiratory systems.",
            "So it gives us virtual access to the lungs, which is where many important diseases reside.",
            "And we also found bacteria that normally inhabit the gut.",
            "And so we can also now virtually gain access to this even more distant organ system that, from the skeleton alone, has long decomposed.",
            "And so by applying ancient DNA sequencing and protein mass spectrometry technologies to ancient dental calculus, we can generate immense quantities of data that then we can use to begin to reconstruct a detailed picture of the dynamic interplay between diet, infection and immunity thousands of years ago.",
            "So what started out as an idea, is now being implemented to churn out millions of sequences that we can use to investigate the long-term evolutionary history of human health and disease, right down to the genetic code of individual pathogens.",
            "And from this information we can learn about how pathogens evolve and also why they continue to make us sick.",
            "And I hope I have convinced you of the value of dental calculus.",
            "And as a final parting thought, on behalf of future archeologists, I would like to ask you to please think twice before you go home and brush your teeth."

            "J'ai l'impression que  lorsque l'on part en vacances  c'est très fréquent,  c'est à dire qu'on part en vacances,  d'une certaine manière,  aux ordres de notre \"moi du souvenir\".",

            "La distinction entre  le bonheur de notre \"moi de l'expérience\"  et la satisfaction de notre \"moi du souvenir\"  n'a été comprise que très récemment,  et il ya maintenant des projets afin de mesurer les deux séparement.  L'organisation Gallup a réalisé un sondage  auprès de 500 000 personnes  en leur demandant ce qu'ils  pensaient de leur vies  et de leurs expériences.",

            "Vous avez tant d'incertitude.",

            "Ce sont deux notions très différentes.",
            "Pour faire court,  une autre raison qui nous empêche d'avoir les idées claires sur le bonheur,  c'est qu'on ne se préoccupe pas des mêmes choses  quand on réfléchit à la vie ou bien lorsqu'on la vit.",

            "Ce qu'il faut faire là paraît simple, mais ça ne l'est pas,  c'est de prendre tout le CO2, après la combustion, le sortir du circuit,  le mette sous pression, le rendre liquide, le mettre quelque part,  et espérer qu'il y reste.",
            "Il y a des projets avancés permettant de réaliser cela à 60 à 80 %,  mais arriver à 100%, ça sera très délicat,  et ce sera difficile de convenir de l'endroit où tout ce CO2 devrait être mis,  mais le plus dur est ici la question du long terme.",

            "Le coût, en particulier dans les pays fortement réglementés, est élevé.",
            "La question de la sécurité, d'être vraiment sûrs qu'il n y aura pas de problème,  que, même en ayant des opérateurs humains,  le combustible ne soit pas utilisé pour les armes.",
            "Et puis, que faire avec les déchets?",
            "Et, bien que le volume ne soit pas pas très impotant, il pose de nombreux problèmes.",

            "Les trois derniers des cinq, je les ai regroupés.",
            "Ce sont ceux auxquels les gens font souvent référence en tant qu'énergies renouvelables.",
            "Mais en fait - même si c'est génial qu'elles ne nécessitent aucun carburant --  elles présentent quelques inconvénients.",
            "Le premier est que la densité d'énergie produite grâce à ces technologies  est considérablement inférieure à celle d'une centrale électrique.",
            "Il s'agit de fermes à énergie, on parle là de nombreux kilomètres carrés,  des milliers de fois plus d'espace que pour une centrale à énergie normale.",
            "De plus ce sont des sources fonctionnant par intermittence.",
            "Le soleil ne brille pas toute la journée, il ne brille pas tous les jours,  et, pareillement, le vent ne souffle pas tout le temps.",
            "Et donc, si vous dépendez de ces sources,  vous devez avoir un moyen d'obtenir de l'énergie  pendant ces périodes de temps où elle n'est pas disponible.",
            "Nous avons ici de gros problèmes de coûts .",
            "Nous avons des problèmes de transmission.",
            "Par exemple, disons que cette source d'énergie est en dehors de votre pays,  alors non seulement vous avez besoin de la technologie,  mais vous devez faire face au risque d'une énergie venue d'ailleurs.",
            "Et, finalement, il y a ce problème de stockage.",
            "Alors, pour dimensionner cela, j'ai étudié  tous les types de batteries qu'on fabrique,  pour les voitures, pour les ordinateurs, les téléphones, les lampes de poche, pour tout,  et comparé cela à la quantité d'énergie électrique utilisée dans le monde,  et ce que j'ai constaté, c'est que la totalité des batteries que nous faisons aujourd'hui  pourrait stocker moins de 10 minutes de toute l'énergie.",
            "Alors, en fait, nous avons besoin d'une percée importante ici,  quelque chose qui puisse améliorer d'un facteur de 100  les approches que nous avons actuellement.",
            "Ce n'est pas impossible, mais ce n'est pas une chose très facile.",
            "C'est ce qu'on voit quand on essaie d'obtenir d'une source intermittente  plus de, disons, 20 à 30 pour cent de ce qu'on utilise.",
            "Si on compte sur cette source pour fournir les 100%,  vous avez besoin d'une incroyable batterie miracle.",
            "Bon, essayons d'avancer sur la question de la bonne approche à adopter.",
            "Est-ce que c'est un nouveau \"Projet Manhattan\" ? Quels moyens pour y arriver ?",

            "Il ya quelques innovations dans le nucléaire: modulaire, liquide.",
            "Et l'innovation avait vraiment cessé dans cette industrie depuis un certain temps,  Alors, l'idée qu'il y ait quelques bonnes idées qui traînent n'est pas surprenant.",
            "L'idée de Terrapower est, qu'au lieu de brûler une partie de l'uranium,  ce un pour cent, qui est le U235,  on a décidé de brûler les autres 99 %, le U238.",
            "C'est une idée un peu folle.",
            "En fait, ça faisait longtemps que des gens en parlaient,  mais ils n'étaient jamais arrivés à simuler correctement si ça marcherait ou non,  alors c'est grâce à l'avènement des super-ordinateurs modernes  qu'on a pu effectuer la simulation, et voir que, oui,  avec la bonne approche sur les matériaux, il semble que ça peut marcher.",
            "Et, parce que vous brûlez ces 99 pour cent,  vous avez énormément amélioré le profil des coûts.",
            "Ce que vous brûlez, ce sont les déchets, et vous pouvez utiliser comme combustible  tous les surplus de déchets produits par les réacteurs d'aujourd'hui.",
            "Ainsi, au lieu de s'en inquiéter à leur sujet, on les utilise. Ça, c'est quelque chose.",
            "Ça aspire cet uranium en fonctionnant. C'est un peu comme une bougie.",
            "Vous pouvez voir ça comme une bûche, on en a souvent parlé comme du \"réacteur à vague d'ondes\".",

            "Donc, pour arriver à ces 80 %,  les pays développés, y compris des pays comme la Chine,  auront eu à transformer complètement leurs méthodes de production d'électricité.",
            "Le niveau suivant, ce sera de mettre en oeuvre cette technologie zéro émission,  de l'avoir mise en oeuvre dans tous les pays développés  et d'être en passe de le faire dans les autres pays.",
            "C'est super important.",
            "C'est un élément essentiel pour tenir la feuille de route.",
            "Alors, en revenant en arrière à partir de là, à quoi ressemble la feuille de route de 2020 ?",
            "Eh bien, là encore, on devrait avoir les deux éléments.",

            "Moins nous émettons, moins grande sera la somme de CO2,  et, par conséquent, moins chaude sera la température.",
            "Mais à certains égards, le niveau que nous atteindrons ici,  en faisant des choses qui ne conduisent pas tout de suite à d'importantes réductions,  n'est pas plus important, et peut-être même moins, que cet autre,  qui est l'innovation sur laquelle reposent ces percées.",

            "C'est celui qui aurait le plus grand impact.",
            "Si ce souhait ne se réalise pas,  la division entre les gens qui pensent à court terme et à long terme sera terrible,  entre les Etats-Unis et la Chine, entre pays pauvres et pays riches,  et la vie sera bien pire pour la plupart de ces deux milliards de gens.",

            "Pour finaliser le logiciel avec le supercalculateur,  embaucher les meilleurs scientifiques, ce que nous avons fait,  ça se chiffre seulement en dizaines de millions,  et même en ayant testé nos matériels dans un réacteur russe  pour s'assurer qu'ils fonctionnent correctement,  on arrive seulement dans les centaines de millions",
            "Le plus dur est la construction du réacteur pilote,  trouver les quelques milliards, trouver le régulateur, l'emplacement  voilà comment on construira le premier.",
            "Une fois que le premier sera construit, si tout fonctionne comme annoncé,  alors ça deviendra une évidence, avec des données économiques et une densité d'énergie,  tellement différentes de celles du nucléaire que nous connaissons.",
            "Alors, pour bien comprendre, cela implique de construire, profond dans le sol,  quelque chose comme une sorte de colonne verticale de combustible nucléaire,  faite de cet uranium appauvri,  et puis le processus commence par le haut et continue vers le bas ?",
            "C'est ça. Aujourd'hui, on doit constamment ravitailler le réacteur en carburant,  ça nécessite donc beaucoup de gens et beaucoup de contrôles peuvent mal tourner,  comme quand il faut l'ouvrir, et y faire entrer et sortir des choses.",
            "Ce n'est pas bon.",
            "Mais si on a un carburant très bon marché qu'on peut y mettre pour 60 ans --  pensez-y simplement comme à une bûche --  le poser là sans avoir tous ces mêmes problèmes complexes.",
            "Il est là, il va brûler pendant les 60 ans et puis c'est fini.",
            "Il s'agit d'une centrale nucléaire qui est sa propre solution d'élimination des déchets.",
            "Oui. Eh bien, ce qui se passe avec les déchets, c'est que  vous pouvez les laisser sur place - il y a beaucoup moins de déchets avec cette approche --  et puis vous pouvez les récupérer,  les mettre dans un autre réacteur et brûler le tout.",
            "En fait, on démarre avec les déchets qui existent aujourd'hui,  qui sont dans ces bassins de refroidissement dans des tonneaux secs, près du réacteur.",
            "C'est ça, le carburant avec lequel on commence.",
            "Ce qui a été un problème avec les anciens réacteurs,  c'est ce qui nourrit le nôtre,  et on réduit radicalement le volume des déchets  avec ce processus.",
            "Mais quand vous parlez aux gens autour de vous, dans le monde entier,  des possibilités qu'on a ici,  où montre-t-on le plus d'intérêt à en faire réellement quelque chose ?",
            "Eh bien, nous n'avons pas choisi de lieu particulier,  et il y a toutes ces règles de divulgation concernant tout ce qui se rapporte au nucléaire,  alors, nous éveillons donc beaucoup d'intérêt,  et la société a envoyé des gens en Russie, en Inde, en Chine.",
            "Je suis retourné voir le Secrétaire à l'Énergie ici,  parler de comment cela s'intègre dans l'agenda énergétique.",
            "Je suis optimiste. Vous savez que les Français et les Japonais ont fait du bon travail.",
            "Il s'agit là d'une variante de quelque chose qui a déjà été réalisé.",
            "C'est un progrès important, mais c'est comme un réacteur rapide,  et de nombreux pays en ont déjà construits,  donc chacun de ceux-là est candidat pour être le premier pays où nous construirons le premier..",
            "Quels sont, selon vous, l'échéance et la probabilité  de mener cela à bien dans la réalité ?",
            "Eh bien, pour une de ces unités de production électrique à grande échelle,  et ce n'est qu'une approximation,  nous devons compter 20 an pour inventer, et 20 ans pour mettre en œuvre.",
            "C'est à ce genre d'échéance que les modèles environnementaux  nous ont montré qu'il fallait nous attendre.",
            "Et, vous savez, Terrapower, si les choses vont bien, ce qui est beaucoup espérer,  pourrait facilement tenir ces délais.",
            "Et il y a heureusement, aujourd'hui, des dizaines d'entreprises,  et il faut qu'il y en ait des centaines,  qui pourront, si le côté scientifique avance bien,  et si le financement de leurs usines pilotes se passe bien,  entrer aussi dans la compétition.",
            "Et ce sera mieux si on assiste à plusieurs succès,  car alors on pourra utiliser un mélange de tout ça.",
            "Il faut absolument qu'un de ces projets réussisse.",
            "En termes de changements des règles du jeu à grande échelle,  est-ce que c'est le plus important dont vous ayez entendu parler ?",
            "Une percée dans le domaine de l'énergie est la chose la plus importante.",
            "Ça l'aurait été, même sans la contrainte de l'environnement,  mais la contrainte environnementale la rend simplement tellement plus importante.",
            "Dans le domaine nucléaire, il y a d'autres innovateurs.",
            "Vous savez, on ne connait pas aussi bien leur travail que celui-ci,  mais il y a ceux qui étudient l'approche par modules, c'est une approche différente.",
            "Il y a le réacteur de type liquide, ce qui semble un peu difficile,  mais c'est peut-être ce qu'ils pensaient aussi de nous.",
            "Donc, il y a différentes voies,  mais la beauté de tout ça, c'est qu'une molécule d'uranium  renferme un million de fois plus d'énergie qu'une molécule de, disons, de charbon,  et qu'ainsi, si l'on sait traiter les aspects négatifs,  c'est à dire essentiellement la radiation,  alors, l'empreinte et le coût, le potentiel,  en termes d'effets sur la terre et sur le reste,  le place quasiment dans une catégorie à part.",
            "Et si ça ne marche pas, alors que faire ?",
            "Devons-nous commencer à prendre des mesures d'urgence  pour essayer de garder stable la température de la terre?",
            "Si vous arrivait dans cette situation,  ce serait comme si vous aviez trop mangé, et que vous étiez prêt à avoir un infarctus.",
            "Alors, où allez-vous? Il vous faut une chirurgie cardiaque ou quelque chose comme ça.",
            "Il ya une ligne de recherche sur ce qu'on appelle la géo-ingénierie,  portant sur différentes techniques, qui retarderaient le réchauffement,  pour gagner les 20 ou 30 ans nécessaires pour nous prendre en main.",
            "Ce n'est rien de plus qu'une police d'assurance.",
            "On espère ne pas en avoir besoin.",
            "Certains disent qu'il ne faudrait même pas travailler dans cette direction,  car elle pourrait nous rendre paresseux,  comme si vous continuiez à manger parce que vous savez que la chirurgie cardiaque sera là pour vous sauver.",
            "Je ne suis pas sûr que ce soit avisé, étant donné l'ampleur du problème,  mais, bon, il y a cette histoire de géo-ingénierie,  à garder au fond de la poche, au cas où les choses arrivent plus vite que prévu,  ou que l'innovation soit beaucoup plus lente.",
            "Les climato-sceptiques : si vous aviez une ou deux phrases à leur dire,  comment pourriez-vous les persuader qu'ils ont tort?",
            "Eh bien, malheureusement, les sceptiques sont dans des camps différents.",
            "Ceux dont les arguments sont scientifiques sont très peu nombreux.",
            "Disent-ils qu'il y a des effets de rétroaction négative  qui ont à voir avec les nuages qui ont compensé les choses?",
            "Il y a très, très peu de choses qu'ils puissent même dire,  il y a une chance sur un million pour cela.",
            "Le principal problème que nous ayons ici est un peu comme avec le SIDA.",
            "Vous faites une erreur maintenant, et vous en payez le prix beaucoup plus tard.",
            "Quand vous avez n'importe quel genre de problème urgent,  cette idée de souffrir maintenant, avec un gain plus tard --  par rapport à une douleur dont on n'est pas sûrs.",
            "En fait, le rapport du Groupe d’experts Intergouvernemental sur l’Evolution du Climat, ce n'est pas nécessairement le pire des cas,  et il ya des gens dans les pays riches qui regardent le GIEC  et se disent \"Ok, ce n'est pas si important.\"",
            "Le fait est que c'est cette part d'incertitude qui devrait nous pousser dans cette direction.",
            "Mais mon rêve est que, si vous pouvez faire que ce soit économique,  et répondre aux contraintes de CO2,  alors les sceptiques diront : \"OK,  ça m'est égal qu'il ne rejette pas de CO2,  j'aurais préféré qu'il émette du CO2,  mais je crois que je vais l'accepter parce que c'est meilleur marché que ceux d'avant.",
            "Et alors, ce serait votre réponse à l'argument de Bjorn Lomborg,  que, si on dépense toute cette énergie à essayer de résoudre le problème du CO2,  ça va l'emporter tous les autres objectifs,  comme d'essayer de débarrasser le monde de la pauvreté et du paludisme, etc.  Que c'est un gaspillage stupide des ressources que de dépenser de l'argent  pour ça,quand il y a bien mieux à faire.",
            "Eh bien, les dépenses réellement consacrées en Recherche & Développement --  disons, si les États-Unis dépensaient 10 milliards de plus par an qu'actuellement --  ce ne serait pas si dramatique.",
            "Ça ne remettrait pas les autres postes de dépense en cause.",
            "Là où les gens raisonnables peuvent ne pas être d'accord, et on parle ici de grosses sommes,  c'est quand vous avez quelque chose de pas économique, et que vous essayez de le financer.",
            "C'est surtout ça, pour moi, qui est du gâchis.",
            "Sauf si on est très proche de la solution, et que ce qu'on finance c'est la progression du savoir,  et que ça va être très bon marché.",

Dans cet exposé très personnel, il révèle sa fascination dès l'enfance pour le fantastique - que ce soit la lecture de la science-fiction ou la plongée sous-marine - et comment cela a conduit au succès de ses films \"Aliens\", \"Terminator\", \"Titanic\" et \"Avatar\".",

            "Et cela a donné le premier personnage électronique  en image de synthèse  qu'on ait jamais vu dans un film.",

            "Et ça a marché. Et à nouveau nous avons créé la magie.",
            "Et nous avons eu le même résultat avec le public",
            "Même si nous avons fait un peu plus d'argent sur ce coup.",
            "Ainsi, en tirant un trait entre ces deux points  d'expérience,  ce à quoi on était arrivés, que ça allait être un tout nouveau monde,  c'était tout un nouveau monde de créativité  pour les artistes du cinéma.",
            "Alors, j'ai monté une société avec Stan Winston,  mon cher ami, Stan Winston,  qui était le meilleur concepteur de maquillages et de créatures  à l'époque, et on l'a appelée \"Digital Domain\".",
            "Et le concept de la société était  de faire directement le bond  par dessus les procédés analogiques des bancs optiques,  et d'aller directement à la production numérique.",
            "Ce que nous avons fait et qui nous a donné un avantage concurrentiel pour un certain temps.",
            "Mais on a pris du retard dans le milieu des années 90  dans le design des personnages et des créatures  pour lesquels nous avions créé cette société.",
            "Alors, j'ai écrit ce scénario que j'ai appelé \"Avatar\",  qui avait pour but de repousser totalement les frontières  des effets visuels,  des effets numériques,  avec des personnages humains réalistes, capables d'émotions,  générés en image de synthèse.  Et les personnages principaux seraient tous en image de synthèse.  Et le monde serait en image de synthèse.  Et on allait repousser les frontières.",
            "Et là, les gars de ma société m'ont dit  qu'on n'allait pas être capables de faire ça avant un bon moment.",
            "Donc, je l'ai mis de côté, et j'ai fait cet autre film sur un grand navire qui coule.",
            "Vous savez, je suis allé résumer ça au studio comme \"Roméo et Juliette sur un bateau\"",

            "En secret, ce que je voulais faire, c'était  plonger sur l'épave réelle du \"Titanic\".",
            "Et c'est pour ça que j'ai fait le film.",
            "Et c'est la vérité. Bon, le studio ne savait pas.",
            "Mais je les ai convaincus. J'ai dit:  \"Nous allons plonger sur l'épave. Nous allons la filmer pour de vrai.",

            "Ce sera vraiment important. Ce sera une super accroche marketing.\"",
            "Et je leur ai parlé de financer une expédition.",
            "Ça semble fou. Mais on revient à cette idée  de votre imagination qui crée une réalité.",
            "Parce que nous avons en fait créé une réalité où six mois plus tard  je me retrouvais dans un submersible russe,  à 4 km de profondeur dans l'Atlantique Nord,  à regarder le Titanic réel à travers un hublot,  pas un film, non de la HD, mais pour de vrai.",
            "Sérieusement, j'étais en état de choc.",
            "Il a fallu beaucoup de préparation, on a dû construire des caméras  et des lumières et toutes sortes de choses.",
            "Mais, ça m'a frappé à quel point  cette plongée, ces profondes plongées,  ressemblaient à une mission spatiale.",
            "Vous savez, ce côté très technique,  et qui nécessite énormément de planification.",
            "Vous montez dans cette capsule, vous descendez dans cet environnement  sombre et hostile  où il n'y a aucun espoir de sauvetage  si vous n'arrivez pas à vous en sortir vous-même.",
            "Et là j'ai pensé: \"Wow. C'est comme si  je vivais dans un film de science-fiction.",
            "C'est vraiment cool.\"",
            "Et oui, j'ai vraiment été mordu par le virus de l'exploration des fonds océaniques.",
            "Évidemment, encore la curiosité, et le côté scientifique.",
            "C'était tout ça. C'était l'aventure,  C'était la curiosité. C'était l'imagination.",
            "Et ce fut une expérience  qu'Hollywood ne pouvait pas me donner.",
            "Parce que, vous savez, je pouvais imaginer une créature, et on pouvait  créer un effet visuel pour elle. Mais je ne pouvais pas imaginer ce que je voyais  par cette fenêtre.",
            "Et lors de certaines de nos expéditions ultérieures  j'ai vu des créatures à proximité des cheminées hydrothermales  et parfois des choses que je n'avais jamais vues avant,  parfois des choses que personne n'avait jamais vues auparavant,  qui n'avaient jamais encore été décrites par la science  au moment où nous les avons vues et filmées.",
            "Alors, je suis vraiment tombé raide dingue de tout ça,  et il m'en a fallu plus encore.",
            "Et ainsi, j'ai pris une décision assez curieuse.",
            "Après le succès de \"Titanic\",  je me suis dit: «OK, je vais mettre de côté mon boulot  de réalisateur de films à Hollywood,  et je vais devenir explorateur à temps plein pendant un moment.\"",
            "Et on a commencé la planification de ces  expéditions.",
            "Et nous nous sommes retrouvés à aller explorer le Bismark,  et l'explorer avec des véhicules robotisés.",
            "Nous sommes retournés à l'épave du Titanic.",
            "Nous avons pris les petits robots que nous avions créés,  ceux qui déroulaient de la fibre optique.",
            "L'idée était d'aller dedans, et de faire une étude de l'intérieur  de ce navire, ce qui n'avait jamais été fait.",
            "Personne n'avait jamais regardé à l'intérieur de l'épave. Ils n'avaient pas les moyens de le faire,  mais nous avons créé la technologie pour le faire.",
            "Donc, voilà, je suis maintenant, là, sur le pont  du Titanic, assis dans un submersible,  à regarder des planches qui ressemblent beaucoup à celles-ci,  où je savais que l'orchestre avait joué.",
            "Et je suis aux commandes d'un petit véhicule robotisé  qui traverse le couloir du navire.",
            "En fait, je le contrôle à distance,  mais mon esprit est dans le véhicule.",
            "Je me sentais comme si j'étais physiquement présent  à l'intérieur de l'épave du Titanic.",
            "Et c'était la plus surréaliste expérience  de déjà-vu que j'ai jamais vécue,  parce qu'avant de prendre un tournant, je savais déjà  ce qu'il allait y avoir là, avant même que les lumières  du véhicule le révèlent,  parce que j'avais arpenté la scène de tournage pendant des mois  quand nous faisions le film.",
            "Et la scène était construite comme une réplique exacte  basée sur les plans du navire.",
            "Oui, c'était une expérience absolument remarquable.",
            "Et ça m'a vraiment fait comprendre une chose,  l'expérience de la téléprésense,  que vous pouvez vraiment éprouver avec ces avatars robotiques,  que votre conscience est injectée dans le véhicule,  dans cette autre forme d'existence.",
            "C'était vraiment vraiment très profond.",
            "Et peut-être un petit aperçu de ce qui pourra se passer  dans quelques décennies  quand nous commencerons à avoir des corps cyborgs  pour l'exploration ou dans d'autres buts  dans de nombreux  futurs post-humains,  comme je puis l'imaginer,  en tant que fan de science-fiction.",
            "Donc, après avoir fait ces expéditions,  et vraiment commencé à apprécier ce qu'il y avait là, en bas,  comme ces cheminées dans les profondeurs de l'océan,  là où nous avons eu ces animaux fascinants.",
            "Ce sont des étrangers au vrai sens du terme, ici, sur Terre.",
            "Ils vivent dans un environnement de chimiosynthèse.",
            "Ils ne survivent pas dans un système  basé sur la lumière du Soleil, comme nous le faisons.",
            "Et alors, vous pouvez voir des animaux qui vivent à côté de  geysers d'eau chaude,  à plus de 500°C.",
            "On ne croirait pas qu'ils puissent exister.",
            "En même temps  je commençais à être aussi très intéressé par la science spatiale,  à nouveau, l'influence de la science-fiction, comme quand j'étais gosse.",
            "Et j'ai fini par être impliqué dans  la communauté spatiale,  réellement impliqué avec la NASA,  à siéger au conseil consultatif de la NASA,  à planifier de vraies missions dans l'espace,  à aller en Russie, suivre les protocoles biomédicaux  de sélection des cosmonautes,  et toutes ces sortes de choses,  dans le but de m'envoler pour de bon pour la Station spatiale internationale  avec nos systèmes de caméras 3D.",
            "Et c'était fascinant.",
            "Mais ce que j'ai fini par faire, c'est d'amener des scientifiques de l'espace  avec nous dans les profondeurs.",
            "Et les emmener au fond, qu'ils aient accès,  astrobiologistes, scientifiques planétologistes,  des gens intéressés par ces environnements extrêmes,  de les descendre jusqu'aux cheminées, et les laisser voir,  prélever des échantillons, prendre leurs instruments de test, et ainsi de suite.",
            "Bon, là, nous tournions des films documentaires,  mais en fait on faisait de la science,  et même de la science spatiale.",
            "J'avais complètement bouclé la boucle  entre le fan de science-fiction,  vous savez, le gamin,  et faire ce genre de choses pour de vrai.",
            "Et vous savez, tout au long de ce voyage  de découverte,  j'ai beaucoup appris.",
            "J'ai beaucoup appris sur la science. Mais j'ai également beaucoup appris  sur le leadership.",
            "Vous vous dites qu'un metteur en scène se doit d'être un leader,  un chef, un capitaine du navire, et tout ce genre de chose.",
            "Je n'avais pas vraiment appris grand chose sur le leadership  jusqu'à ce que j'aie fait ces expéditions.",
            "Parce que j'ai dû, à un certain point, me dire,  \"Qu'est-ce que je fais ici ?",

Qui construit la plus haute tour, avec ces ingrédients ? Et pourquoi un groupe inattendu fait-il toujours mieux que la moyenne ?",

            "Le marshmallow doit être placé au sommet.",
            "Bien que cela semble vraiment simple, c'est en fait plutôt difficile,  parce que ça oblige les gens  à collaborer rapidement.",
            "J'ai trouvé que c'était une idée intéressante,  alors je l'ai insérée dans un atelier de conception.",
            "Et ça a été un grand succès.",
            "Depuis, j'ai dirigé  environ 70 ateliers de conception dans le monde entier,  avec des étudiants, des designers et des architectes,  et même les Directeurs Techniques d'entreprises du Fortune 50,  et il y a quelque chose dans cet exercice  qui révèle de profonds enseignements  sur la nature de la collaboration,  et j'aimerais en partager certains avec vous.",
            "Bon, normalement la plupart des gens commencent  par prendre leurs marques par rapport à la tâche.",
            "Ils en parlent, ils cherchent à quoi ça va ressembler,  ils manoeuvrent pour le pouvoir,  et puis ils passent un peu de temps à planifier, à organiser.",
            "Ils font des croquis, et disposent les spaghettis.  Ils passent la majeure partie de leur temps  à assembler les bâtons en structures de plus en plus grandes,  et puis, à la fin, juste quand le délai se rapproche,  quelqu'un prend le marshmallow,  et le pose précautionneusement au sommet,  puis ils reculent, et ... Ta-daaa !",
            "Ils admirent leur travail.",
            "Mais en fait, ce qui arrive, la plupart du temps,  c'est que le \"ta-daa\" se termine en \"oh-oh\"  parce que le poids du marshmallow fait que toute la structure  se déforme et s'écroule.",
            "Il y a un certain nombre de participants  qui ont bien plus de \"oh-oh\" que les autres,  et, parmi les pires, les jeunes diplômés des écoles de commerce.",
            "Ils mentent, ils trichent, ils sont distraits,  et les structures qu'ils produisent sont vraiment boiteuses .",

            "C'est la crise.",
            "Ça vous rappelle quelque chose ? Parfait.",
            "Ce que les équipes de maternelle font différemment,  c'est qu'elles commencent par le marshmallow,  et construisent des prototypes, des prototypes successifs,  en gardant toujours le marshmallow au sommet,  et ont ainsi de nombreuses occasions de réparer les prototypes en difficulté.",
            "Les concepteurs reconnaitront ce type de coopération  comme la base essentielle du processus itératif.",
            "Avec chaque version, les enfants ont un retour d'information instantané  sur ce qui marche ou pas.",

            "Pour les étudiants c'est une sacrée expérience, mais pour une école, cela peut s'avérer très difficile ou coûteux.",
            "Et nous savons que la plupart des cours d'anatomie, n'ont pas de laboratoire de dissection de cadavres.",
            "C'est peut-être pour ces raisons, où selon où vous êtes, qu'il peut être difficile de se procurer des cadavres.",
            "Pour trouver une solution, nous avons développé avec le Dr. Brown à Stanford la table de dissection virtuelle.",
            "Nous l'avons appelée Anatomage Table.",
            "Avec cette Anatomage Table, les étudiants peuvent apprendre comment disséquer sans cadavre humain.",
            "Et la forme de la table est importante, et puisqu'elle est tactile, tout comme on dissèque dans un labo, et même exactement comme les chirurgiens opèrent un patient vous pouvez littéralement interagir avec la table.",
            "Notre corps numérique est grandeur nature, c'est donc exactement comme ça que les étudiants verront la vraie anatomie.",
            "Je vais vous montrer.",

            "Je vais découper.",
            "Je peux découper comme je veux, je découpe donc ici.",

            "Bon, je vais faire une autre incision.",
            "Ici.",

            "Comme ça.",
            "Si ces images vous mettent mal à l'aise ou vous gênent, ça veut dire que nous avons fait du bon boulot.",

            "Vous pouvez voir l'oreillette et les ventricules, comment le sang circule dans nos artères et dans nos veines.",
            "Comme ça, les étudiants peuvent isoler n'importe quoi et disséquer n'importe comment.",
            "Ce n'est pas forcément toujours une dissection.",
            "Puisque c'est numérique, nous pouvons faire une dissection à l'envers.",
            "Je vais vous montrer, je vais commencer par le squelette, et je peux ajouter quelques organes internes.",
            "Et oui.",
            "Je peux peut-être les ajouter rapidement comme ça.",

            "Nous pouvons voir les tendons et les muscles.",
            "Si seulement je pouvais me muscler aussi rapidement.",
            "Et c'est une autre manière d'apprendre l'anatomie.",
            "Une autre chose que je peux vous montrer, ce qui arrive souvent, c'est que les médecins découvrent leurs patients par les radiographies.",
            "Donc, l'Anatomage Table montre exactement comment l'anatomie apparait sur les radios.",
            "Vous pouvez également interagir avec les radios, et si vous voulez, vous pouvez aussi comparer avec l'anatomie telle qu'elle apparait sur les radios.",
            "Quand vous avez fini, vous réinitialisez le corps et il est prêt pour une autre session.",

            "Le problème avec ces brevets c'est que les mécanismes sont obscurs et le système de brevetabilité présente des dysfonctionnements, et par conséquent, la plupart de ces procès finissent en règlements.",

            "Dans le cas de Gooseberry Natural Resources ce brevet sur l'envoi par mail d'actualités avait une sorte de défaut mortel vu qu’il me concernait c'est-à-dire que généralement dans le monde médiatique il y a une seule définition pour l'actualité, et il se trouve que c'est les communiqués de presse -- comme dans C.P.",

            "Et elles ont commencé à négocier.",
            "La raison pour laquelle elles ont négocié est qu'il est moins cher de négocier que d'affronter le procès -- clairement, parfois, deux millions de dollars moins cher, et bien plus si en fait vous perdez le procès.",

            "Voici donc la ligne du 50% c'est à dire le choix au hasard.",
            "Et surtout si le partenaire attire l'attention, il choisit plus souvent.",

            "Un philosophe nous a même écrit qu'il était impossible que les singes aient un sens d'équité parce que l'équité a été inventée pendant la Révolution Française.",
            "Un autre a écrit un chapitre tout entier qui dit qu'il croirait que c'est lié à l'équité si celui qui reçoit le raisin refusait le raisin.",
            "Ce qui est amusant c'est que Sarah Brosnan, qui fait ça avec les chimpanzés, a eu deux ou trois combinaisons de chimpanzés où, en effet, celui qui obtenait le raisin le refusait jusqu'à ce que l'autre aussi en obtienne.",

            "L'idée de la chirurgie n'était pas très attrayante.",
            "L'idée de la warfarine était vraiment effrayante.",

Chritina Warinner, TED Fellow, es généticienne archéologue, et elle a trouvé un nouvel outil spectaculaire -- de l'ADN microbien dans de la plaque dentaire fossilisée.",

            "Mais ce n'est qu'une moitié de l'histoire.",
            "Les problèmes de santé les plus importants aujourd'hui ne sont pas causés par de simples mutations dans notre génome, mais sont plutôt le résultat d'une interaction complexe et dynamique entre la variation génétique, le régime alimentaire, les microbes et les parasites et notre réponse immunitaire.",
            "Toutes ces maladies ont une forte composante évolutive qui est directement liée au fait que nous vivons aujourd'hui dans un environnement très différent que ceux dans lesquels notre corps a évolué.",
            "Et afin de comprendre ces maladies, on doit dépasser les études du seul génome humain pour aller vers une approche plus globale de la santé humaine dans le passé.",

            "Et lors d'un controle dentaire typique, on peut vous en enlever environ 15 à 30 milligrammes.",
            "Mais dans les temps anciens, avant le brossage des dents, jusqu'à 600 milligrammes pouvaient s'accumuler sur les dents au cours d'une vie entière.",
            "Et ce qui est vraiment important avec le calcul dentaire est qu'il se fossilise tout comme le reste du squelette, il en trouve en grande quantité avant aujourd'hui et il est omniprésent dans le monde entier.",
            "Nous en trouvons chez chaque population du monde entier à toutes les époques en remontant des dizaines de milliers d'années.",

            "Ils avaient regardé le calcul dentaire sous le microscope, et ils avaient trouvé des choses comme du pollen et des amidons de végétaux, et ils avaient trouvé des cellules musculaires de viande animale et les bactéries.",
            "Et donc ce que mon équipe de chercheurs, ce que nous voulions faire, c'est, pouvons-nous appliquer la génétique et la technologie protéomique pour chercher de l'ADN et des protéines, et de là pouvons-nous obtenir une meilleure résolution taxonomique pour vraiment comprendre ce qui se passe ?",
            "Et ce que nous avons trouvé est que nous pouvons trouver beaucoup de bactéries commensales et pathogènes qui logeaient dans les voies nasales et la bouche.",
            "Nous avons également trouvé des protéines immunitaires liées à l'infection et l'inflammation et de l'ADN et des protéines liés au régime alimentaire.",
            "Mais ce qui nous a surpris et qui était aussi tout à fait passionnant, est que nous avons également trouvé des bactéries qui logent normalement dans les systèmes respiratoires supérieurs.",
            "Donc cela nous donne un accès virtuel aux poumons, où résident de nombreuses maladies importantes.",
            "Et nous avons également trouvé des bactéries qui logent normalement dans le tube digestif.",
            "Et donc nous pouvons maintenant accéder virtuellement à ce système d'organes encore plus éloigné qui, à partir du squelette seul, s'est décomposé depuis longtemps.",
            "Et donc en appliquant le séquençage de l'ADN ancien et les technologies de spectrométrie de masse des protéines à l'ancien calcul dentaire, nous pouvons générer d'immenses quantités de données qu'alors nous pouvons utiliser pour commencer à reconstruire une image détaillée de l'interaction dynamique entre l'alimentation, l'infection et l'immunité il y a des milliers d'années.",
            "Donc ce qui a commencé comme une idée, est maintenant mis en œuvre pour produire des millions de séquences que nous pouvons utiliser pour enquêter sur l'évolution à long terme de la santé humaine et des maladies, jusqu'au code génétique des agents pathogènes individuels.",
            "Et de ces informations nous pouvons apprendre comment les agents pathogènes évoluent et aussi pourquoi ils continuent de nous rendre malades.",
            "Et j'espère que je vous ai convaincus de la valeur du calcul dentaire.",
            "Et la dernière pensée sur laquelle je veux vous laisser,, au nom des futurs archéologues, je voudrais vous demander de réfléchir à deux fois avant de rentrer chez vous et de vous brossez les dents."
